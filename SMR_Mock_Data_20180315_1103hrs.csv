Due to a report filed with XXXX by M & T Bank in XX/XX/XXXX, I was banned from opening a First Time Home Club savings account with any bank other M & T bank. The charge that was reported to XXXX was grossly inflated due to what I feel were inappropriate NSF charges. Even though I did n't think the report was fair, I did pay the amount owed to M & T, in full, less than one year after it was report to XXXX. Around XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I attempted to open a First Time Home Club account with XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but both were declined due to M & T 's XX/XX/XXXX XXXX report. After being declined by other banks, my housing counselor advised me to speak with M & T to see if they could withdraw the XXXX report. I contacted M & T at a branch to inquire about them withdrawing the XXXX report, but was informed that they could n't do that. However, they told me, I could open the First Time Home Club account with them. It seems preposterous that a company can report someone for a delinquent account ( which I believe was not legitimately delinquent ) & then force that same person to use only that bank. It seems to me that the system is designed ( at least in this instance ) to ensure that a consumer has no choice but to select a certain bank. To make matters worse, after successfully completing the First Time Home Club program and receiving the mortgage, and without informing me, M & T switched our First Time Home Club account to a different type of account that charges a monthly fee of {$7.00}. I believe it is the practice of M & T to do this to others in the First Time Home Club program. The account was charged the {$7.00} fee each month until the balance went negative, then it was written off by M & T -- all without ever disclosing the fees or sending me a statement. Upon completing the First Time Home Club program, I told M & T of our new address ( as was required in order to take funds from that account ) but M & T never updated the address for the account. Interestingly, they did have the correct address for our mortgage account. When I inquired about this with M & T they told me it was my fault for not changing the address and that I can not obtain the funds I had remaining in my account before the fees were charged and the account was written off ( they refused to confirm whether this account was also report to XXXX, but implied it was not ). They also provided me with several old statements and told me a fee was only charged XXXX times, but upon reviewing the statements I discovered at least XXXX as many fees as they claimed.

Exactly one month after the package was delivered, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX charged me {$1200.00}. Of these charges, {$66.00} was for that month 's phone services. The remaining {$1100.00} was for the returned devices, as well as taxes, surcharges, and late fees thereon. In accordance with the Fair Credit Billing Act of XXXX, I initialed a billing inquiry into the matter with the assistance of XXXX XXXX.

The dispute was initiated on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, after XXXX XXXX had failed to respond within the government-allotted 30-day period, XXXX XXXX reversed the charges. 

This should have been the end of the matter, as the Federal Trade Commission plainly states that "" Any creditor who fails to follow the settlement procedure may not collect the amount in dispute, or any related finance charges, up to {$50.00}, even if the bill turns out to be correct '' ( XXXX ). However, on the day that XXXX XXXX reversed the charges, XXXX XXXX immediately cut off my phone service, rebilled me the disputed amount, and also billed me for several new surcharges, including a hefty fee to reinstate the service that they had just shut off before billing me. Those charges came to {$1300.00}. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX, who again reversed the charges, this time banning XXXX XXXX from accessing my funds.

He was given an amount of {$5700.00} and was informed that it was good until XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I went to my bank to pay off the loan. The amount due was sent in XXXX XXXX due to the limits set forth by XXXX. The XXXX one was for {$4000.00} and the XXXX one was for {$1700.00} ( see attached ). They were both sent urgent so that said company would receive them right away. On XXXX/XXXX/16 the other son contacted said company to verify receipt of payoff. He was informed that said company had received the payoff, it had been processed, and the balance was {$0.00}. He then asked about the title and was told that it would be mailed out in the next 5-7 business days. XX/XX/XXXX my son received a statement from said company stating that since the balance on the loan was under {$2500.00} he was now responsible for the insurance starting on XXXX/XXXX/16 ( see attached ). We thought this odd as the loan was paid off and insurance had already been obtained through another company. We were still waiting for the title. On XXXX/XXXX/16 my son received a statement from said company ( see attached ). It stated that he had a payment due of {$140.00}. Strangely, this payment is not due until XXXX/XXXX/16. The other son immediately contacted said company. He was informed that the payoff was processed as a regular payment, not a payoff, and that the amount due was interest. He then explained the loan was paid off and the balance was {$0.00} and asked how could there be interest on a XXXX balance loan. The representative then told him that they were not able to locate the receipts the received from XXXX and in order to clear this up we needed to fax to them a copy of the receipts I had. These were faxed on XXXX/XXXX/16. 
This company has harassed the XXXX out of my son. I took money from my retirement to pay them off to stop all of their XXXX. None of this makes sense. You receive a 10 day payoff amount, pay it in less than 24 hours. The next day you receive verbal confirmation of the transaction and when to expect the title for the vehicle. Then after you should have received the title you get a statement telling you to get the insurance because the loan amount was below a certain level. This is followed by a statement saying money is still due on this loan. After contacting said company you are informed that it was never entered as a payoff and there is still interest due, on a {$0.00} balance loan! Then one discovers the payment in not due until XXXX/XXXX/16. The company also stated that they have no record of the XXXX XXXX payment and we needed to get them a copy of ours. 
It has become apparent that said company has no intentions on releasing this title to my son. This vehicle was paid off, in full, and said company is now attempting to extort more money out of my son. Please investigate this matter and the company. Who knows how many others they are doing this to. My son purchased this vehicle while he was XXXX in the military. No one deserves this treatment, especially our service members. This company needs to be banned from giving loans to service members and their families.",NFA,2,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0

My now deceased husband and I are victims of mortgage fraud, and I have been trying to fix this problem for several years with little progress made. I am led to believe that the current servicer of this loan  is Ocwen a nd the investor is   XXXX   XXXX  . It has been difficult to communicate w ith Ocwen to determine the nex t steps and we are trying to get some type of escalated response to get information and fix this problem.     The current mortgage loan on the property is in the name of  XXXX   XXXX . She was duped into serving as a straw buyer a few years ago after a mortgage frauds ter ( now conv icted and in jail ) had tricked us into deeding our home to him. After the fraud was revealed  XXXX   XXXX  contacted us and wanted to fix the situation and deeded the home back into our name. The ban k (   AHMSI  at the time ) took us to court to try and foreclose, but the judge ruled that due to the mortgage fraud that this was not a legitimate loan and that the foreclosure would not be allowed to move forward. ( I have included this paperwork ). After that happened AHMSI ( loan #  XXXX  ) who was the lender at the time offered a loan modification to us in the name of  XXXX   XXXX . We began making the payments for the loan modification but then  AHMSI was sold to Homeward Residential, and then it became a part of Ocwen. We  got lost in the shuffle and did not know who to talk to, where to send the payments and the agreement ended up getting cancelled. Since that time we have been in limbo trying to resolve this matter but dont know where to turn. I am the rightful heir and owner of the property and occupy the home along with my  XXXX  children. I also rent out a portion of the property to a family in order to increase the household income. Between my salary as a   XXXX   XXXX   and the rent I make a good living and can definitely afford a fair and reasonable mortgage payment. The issue is that I cant make any progress  with Ocwen and cant ge t any information about this mortgage loan, even though I have enlisted the cooperation and blessing of  XXXX   XXXX  who is listed as the borrower on this loan.     My late husband and I have owned this home for 21 years. In   XXXX  , my husband, who was a pastor, was struggling financially and he was approached by a parishioner who told him they could help him.  XXXX   XXXX  entered into a  one year lo an agreement with this individual, but later found that he had deeded the property into the name of the fraudster. The property was then refinanced and/or sold a couple of more times in order to drain all of the equity.  XXXX   XXXX  was asked to do a favor to complete purchase loan paperwork for a motivated borrower who could not qualify for the loan. She had no idea that there was bad intent, but realized after the fraudsters were arrested what happened. She deeded the house out of her name back to me.   We ne ed Ocwen to acknowledge that they are the current holder of this loan, and provide the current loan number. At this time Ocwen is attempting to pursue past due balance amounts from me since I   occupy the home, but currently I am not listed as the borrower on the loan at this time.

Also, I said all my accounts still not connected together as promised before. I cant see them together under the same login online. She said I have to stop by at the branch and we will figure out how to fix everything. I visited  XXXX  next  1-2 da ys. We did revise all accounts I have, including the merchant service. I said I go t letter from PNC 1 day ago and I have it with me. PNC  was asking me to contact them because I didnt activate the merchant device/terminal for credit card. I remind her that I got the merchant ONLY because it was kind of package and I was not going to use it. My main goals were to get unlimited cash deposits with no fees to my checking account and making  Cheshires checks   with no {$10.00} service fee. She said I dont need to do anything now with this letter and she will check what kind of package will work for me better if I dont use merchant at all . In 1-2 days I got form by email to connect all my checking accounts together, but I never got any u pdates about my services, or what I need to change if I need to. As  XXXX  recommended me, I was just waiting for information from her. By the way, I am doing the same thing right now. I am waiting to be contacted as they promised. Periodically, I sent them emails to check if they still remember that I have problems and I fill discomfort because my account charged.     So, I got the {$720.00} charged my checking accoun t  XX/XX/2017  a nd I did contact  XXXX  by eMail asap then I found it on my account. She promised me to contact merchant account the same day and call me back.

Of course, sale is closed and commissions for the sale received. Now customer can wait. Its totally customers problem. I hope I am wrong with this statement.

She was asking to make appointment at   XXXX   XXXX  , but I said I cant do it, because its too late for me. I need appointment as early as we can do it. Then she said it look like she can do it at   XXXX   XXXX  .   I arrived to branch   XX/XX/2017   at   XXXX   XXXX   just in case. In  10 minut es I figured out that something is going wrong becaus e PNC guys was trying to call her cell and find out where she is. PNC workers came to me a nd said it looks like   XXXX    is not going to be at the office, but I can speak with her over the phone. Great! I could do the same thing from my home!  I live 1 hour from the branch. I spoke with her 5-7 minutes and she was trying to say my appointment is  at   XXXX   XXXX    and it looks like its misunderstanding happened again. Its nonsense, because too many misunderstandings are going on already. So, she said we are going to make conference call soon. I was asking to do it next day   XXXX   XXXX  . She said she needs to confirm it with other people involved to this problem and will let me know. Since that time nobody did call me.   So, now I am wasting my time, traveling to  PNC branch It looks like it happened because some PNC workers doesnt really know what k ind of accounts and services packages their company has, if the services have contracts or cancelations fees. I dont want to think the workers new that merchant service has 3 years contract and {$720.00} cancelation fee and just did not tell me about it, but just gave me tons of papers to sign up. I understand that workers need to sell accounts and services, because its their job. But they have to do it responsibly. The customers should know everything what can hurts them later. Now it looks like it was  one big mis understanding then I came to  XXXX   XXXX  office of  PNC  and did open accounts there.   I can give you all my permits if you need them to check the web cameras with my meetings in the PNC office, phone call records, and emails to verify all my words.

Upon request for additional information, he/she decides not to send funds","My mother has owned our home for 45 years and is facing a foreclosure auction on  XXXX   XXXX . This was a situation that could have been avoided but we were given terrible advice by  Bank of America w ho instructed us to miss our mortgage payments so we could try and renegotiate our loan. However, we have spent months and years going back and forth with them and have made no progress. Now they are telling us it is too late, and refuse to open a review of the most recent changes in our financial situation to see if there are any programs we may qualify for to save our home. I realize that we have not been making our payments, but even when this first started and we tried to resume making payments the agents at Ban k of America said th ey would not accept it because we had to cover all late fees, all delinquencies, inspection and Attorney fees etc. I was led to believe that we would miss a couple of payments in order to qualify for review and then this would be handled. Instead it has turned into a nightmare. My mother is  XXXX    years old   and retired and a foreclosure would be devastating.     Our problem with this loan began in   XXXX   when I lost my job. I was able to go onto unemployment and we continued scraping by and making the monthly payment. We reached out to the agents at B ank of America at that time and explained the situation. They told us that they could not help unless we actually MISSED OUR MOR TGAGE PAYMENT. Even though this went against all business principles, we followed their advice. Since the unemployment was ending, it was going to be very tough to continue making the payments, but I believe we could have done so if not advised to stop by the employees at Ban k of America.      After missing a few payments, we began trying to negotiate with the agents at B ank of America to receive a modification based on the changes in our financial situation. This was very lengt hy and cumbersome and we were continually assigned and then reassigned to different account managers. I sent the paperwork in on multiple occasions but it continued to get lost or misplaced. This happened several times, it was not an isolated incident. Finally, after months and months of back and forth Ban k of America con ducted a review of our information, and we were told that the application was denied due to lack of income.     Not long after that I was able to start working again and we now had more income to use to qualify for a modification. During this time frame we attempted to start making mortgage payments again, but as mentioned they would not accept them. My sister was living in the home as well and contributing and we were leery of dealing directly with Bank  of America so we hired a law firm to help us negotiate with the bank. Unfortunately, the law firm did not have much lu ck with B of A either and we were told that they were not going to approve the application, although we were never told why.     Since that time we have been told that our loan has been sold to   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , then to  XXXX   XXXX , then we are told to still make our payments to Bank  XXXX  f America. This  is all very confusing. At this time there is a sale date set for  XXXX   XXXX . We want this sale date postponed, because we were never afforded the opportunity to engage in state mandated mediation. Additionally, there has been a change in our financial circumstances, and we feel that Bank  of America has   purposely avoided reviewing our information for the last several months. We want an opportunity to be considered for all government and internal programs that are available based on our current and correct monthly income. We want to file a formal complaint against B ank of America for the wa y they have handled this loan.",NFA,2,0,0,2,,0,0,0,0

This whole process has been a complete learning process for me. After getting off to a slow start, business finally started to pick up for the month of XXXX. I made sure that every single order was processed and shipped out. Now, due to technical issues with my email support server at XXXX, customers were receiving there order confirmation, but were not receiving their shipping confirmation ( tracking numbers ). Being that customers were not receiving there shipping confirmation emails, they began to get worried and as a result, some customers opened disputes on PayPal as there only way of communication. Once I realized the trend with customers saying they are n't receiving tracking and that emails to XXXXXXXXXXXX were not able to be sent, I quickly called XXXX and worked with them to resolve the issue ( support email is working fine now ). As a result of all the disputes filed, PayPal placed an account limitation on my account which prevented me from accessing my money and demanded I provide extra documents and resolve all of the open disputes. ( Fair enough for the commotion ) During this whole process I was working hand in hand with paypal, sent all the required documents, updated every single customer tracking number, and called every single day to resolve all of the open disputes. I 've dealt with very helpful agents, as well as agents who really did not want to help me at all. At one point they even permanently banned me and realized they did not have any reason to, being that I was working with them diligently, and all the information was presented, ( i.e : confirmed proof of deliver to numerous disputes that were opened ), that they appealed there decision and brought my account back to temporary limited access. I had since been working tirelessly to close out all of the disputes, even taking it as far as allowing PayPal to issue full refunds to certain customers for the inconvenience of the whole situation and still allowing them to keep the product they paid for. On XXXX/XXXX/2017 after working with paypal for over an hour, I was finally able to close out all of the disputes. The representative I worked with was amazing and really helped me out. She then transferred me to the limitation department for review and I was greeted by an underwhelming agent who sounded like she hated her job and was n't so motivated to help. She did not allow me any opportunity to explain my situation at hand prior to her decision. After she had already made the decision to permanently ban my account I literally had to beg her to allow me to speak to someone else. She finally got her supervisor to review the account for me, after he reviewed my account, he said there is nothing they can do because I had already had been granted an appeal before, which was absolutely ludicrous. The only reason I had to even get an appeal done was because I had to deal with an agent who messed up and sent my account to review even though I was not even close to closing off the disputes. Of course they would ban my account, and of course I would have to call them and have them check there records and realize there was no reason for all that to have been done, no reason for my account to have been sent for review so early in the first place, being that everything was being worked on faithfully and with honest intentions. I tried to explain this whole situation to them but they were unwilling to even consider my reasoning and just continued to reiterate there is nothing they can do. This whole situation started from a third party issue with my email server hosted by XXXX and it has since been resolved, so to be banned after spending so much time and effort working with PayPal to prove I am a legitimate business is completely unfair and I really feel like I have been XXXX over big time.",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In  XXXX  I got behind on my payments. I started getting very nasty calls from Bank of America from  XXXX . The calls would be all day long from the hours of  XXXX    XXXX   to  XXXX    XXXX  . If I did not answer a call then I would ge t 3 to 4 calls an hour until I did answer. These came fro m a Texas phone number. I contacted Bank of America who was now the servicer of the loan after the merger with Country Wide. I could not get anyone to tell me how or where I could apply for a loan modification. They transferred me to  one per son after another. In  XXXX   XXXX  I offered to pay {$20000.00} on the past due amount of {$25000.00} then every month I would pay a fe w hundred m ore on the monthly payment until the remaining {$5000.00} was paid off. They said they would take the {$20000.00} but I had  three mo nths to pay the remaining, plus the normal amount of the house payment. I could not do this because as a   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   who was hit very hard in the recession I could not guarantee the extra amount that they wanted.I did not even get a cas e manager  until  XXXX . Then account managers started to change about every 90 days some months did not even have a case  manager.  Then when I got a new case  manager I  would have to explain things all over again. So it was like every 90 days a undo of anything that had been done by my prior account manager.   Then once my business picked up I started asking for a loan modification. I had seen th  XXXX   Affordable Home Care Act was to help people in my   situation. Nothing came of my requests.   Bank of America filed a paper in  XXXX  that they where the  Mortgagee of my home loan with t he  XXXX   county Clerk of Court. T hey then processed with Foreclosure actions. I was not given a trial period to see if I could qualify for a loan modification which I was still asking for.   In  XXXX   XXXX  We had a house fire and was transferred to another department where I talked to  XXXX  to notify Bank of America that there had been a house fire. Only after that did the phone calls from collection department slow down. Bank of America left flyers on the door, I would call them right away to inform them the house was still lived in. A t one  point they said the house was vacant and sent a person to cut the grass. I had paid a lady to cut the grass so it was not needed, this person they sent started cutting the grass and they hit the heating and air unit and knocked it off the foundation. Then shortly after within two weeks the Heating and air units had been stolen.   In  XXXX   XXXX  I went to the hearing at the Master of Equity of  XXXX   County f or the ruling with Bank  of Americans Lawyers. The Judge   XXXX   would not allow me to show or say  anything in this court. The final ruling was the house was to be sold. I could not find an attorney willing to take the case.   Then in  XXXX   XXXX  Bank of  American fi nally let me apply for a loan modification. I faxed all papers for the  Loan h elp program - It came back denied  XXXX   XXXX .   Ban k of American h as wrong information about the house including the square footage of  XXXX  which it 's  XXXX , It 's a brick home, not vinyl,  XXXX  bedrooms  XXXX  baths, not  XXXX  bed  XXXX  baths so on and so on.By Bank of America putting this wrong information in the mortgage file as well as into the courts, it makes it look like I owe a lot more than the value of the house.I asked my account manager what they had in the system as the value of my home they replied {$150.00}. This was a total shock to me as it was appraised at over {$350000.00} when I bought the house. I thought they had that with the loan papers. That alone helped me realize what they were seeing in their system, this information was not correct and why they were not willing to help  me.No one , not even a lawyer would help me. I feel this wrong information was a crime against me to keep me from saving my home I was able to stop the sale of the house because I did not have a case  manager.  Then the house was sold but then they had to undo the sale In  XXXX . I faxed papers each time they sent them and this was many times for  Loan mo difications and the  Loan  help program - It came back denied   XXXX   XXXX    or some just came back denied. I did not ever have a   XXXX   XXXX   loan,   XXXX   XXXX   was the investor only.   XXXX   XXXX   said at any time Bank of America as the loan owner could do a modification.   I filled for  Chapter   XXXX  in  XXXX  Bank of America refused to be part of the Bankruptcy,  My  lawyer had me fill for a loan modification at this time. I got a call they needed more information. I faxed it to them within  24  hrs I get a letter I am denied because of its   XXXX   XXXX    Loan. Tol d by Bank of America you can not have  XXXX  Government loans. Again I do not have a   XXXX   XXXX   loan. During this time Bank of  American did  another home appraisal wrong information again but this time {$220000.00} home value. I tried to talk to them again and show proof the information was wrong. They approve a short sale with deficiencies. The sale of the home at this amount would leave me owing Bank of America money.    XXXX   XXXX   Went to Master of Equity Court h earing where final sale date was set to be  XXXX   XXXX . During this hearing, they waved all deficiency 's against me. At the  Auction  Bank of America bought my home at the sum of {$290000.00}. Why would they pay more than what they said the house was appraisal was for? Now they have control of the house on the website the square footage is correct at  XXXX  sqft. I was also applying at the time of the sale for a loan modification, After making a complaint. They called me on Wednesday to tell me to have the paperwork in with my yearly taxes no later than Monday. She submitted a request to postponed the sale. We had a storm that knocked out the power in the area and it made national news so, I was unable to fax the paperwork till late Monday evening due to the power outages. I got a letter dated  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  that they need more time for my loan request. This letter came after they sold my home.   I have kept a detailed list of everyone I talked to and on what dates. I also on  XXXX  I requested a copy of my full mortgage file including, all  Notes, recordings, paperwork all details of my acco unt.   Here is a sample of the ordeal I have gone through and the run around Bank of America has done.    XXXX  I faxed the first loan modification paperwork to them. Now, this was only allowed after they had foreclosure hearing in the  XXXX   County Master  of Equity Courts. They would not all ow me to apply for a loan modification prior to that time. I called other Banks to get it done and they said I had to work with Bank of America. I could not even get a lawyer to touch this with a ten-foot pole.    XXXX  Bank of America wanted more information that was also faxed in as well  XXXX   XXXX  Got  XXXX  letters from Bank of America dated the same day came at the same time the  1st le tter was telling me what would happen next after they were processing the loan modification paperwork. Th e 2nd  Was to inform me that they could not do a loan modification because it was a   XXXX   XXXX   loan.    XXXX  Talked to a  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  at  XXXX  explained for me to fax her the information which I did to. A fax was sent to  XXXX   XXXX  # on every page.    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  wanted more information so I again sent the information requested to  XXXX .    XXXX  at  XXXX    XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  did call and she informed me she had gotten the information that was sent. If I was approved the next step would be to pay 3 months payments after that the payment interest would go down to 2 % instead of the 6 % which would drop the interest on the payments a great deal. This was exciting news as it was looking good she said she saw no problems with the paperwork.    XXXX  another hanger left on the door to contact Bank of America so I called  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  to see if there was a problem and was able to leave a message that I was calling due to the flyer left on the door.    XXXX  Another packed from Bank of America arrived that looked just like the ones I had filled out prior I filled those out and sent those back as well.    XXXX  Tried all day to reaches  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  left messages on her voice mail.  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  :  XXXX ,  XXXX  :  XXXX ,  XXXX    XXXX    XXXX  Called  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  and called again repetitively leaving messages for her to please call me to let me know whats going on.    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  did call back wanting more information on  XXXX   XXXX  my common law husband and how much income he was putting towards the house. She was mailing me a form letter to fill it out and return it when the letter was received.    XXXX  There was a voicemail message left for me on my phone from  XXXX  Message code was  XXXX .    XXXX  Called  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  at  XXXX  to ask if she got the faxed information I had sent,  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  informed me it takes s 24-48  hrs for faxes to upload to the system. She asked if I had received the packet she sent, I replied at this time no.    XXXX  I called  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  to inform her that the forms had come to please give me a callback.    XXXX  I called at  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  again asking for a return call and then again at  XXXX   XXXX  Called for an appeal for the Makin g Homes Affordable a t  XXXX , they told me in  3-4 d ays they are calling back to see if I can have an appeal.

I consulted a  Real Estate  agent to see about putting the house on market she said since it was in foreclosure Bank of America would take it over and do a short sale on the house. They had the wrong information and low appraisals on the property so I was unable to do that as they had a Deficiency judgment against me.   The lady at the Foreclosur e Escalations department   wanted to know why when I had a credit to my account of  XXXX  I did not make any payments, This was a shock to me as I had sent in payments before and they had always been returned. I was not aware that I could have made payments at this time. The  XXXX  was a Hold on the Check to the fire   contractor that had been making repairs to the home.
Bank of American called the contractor that was doing repairs on the house and told him m  y personal information that I was in foreclosure. Then, of course, he stopped all work on the house.    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  Called at  XXXX   XXXX  I ask her for a new appraisal because the information on the appraisal was wrong the square footage was wrong it was way to small listed, the type of house was a brick, not vinyl, Her reply was  No .

I was extremely upset and completely shocked to find out about this account being against my character and good name. I immediately contacted this compa ny (   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ) and  they instructed me to file a dispute to which they would file upon my behalf. After submitting the written dispute document and several personal documents as well as other pertinent details, the dispute was filed on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX .     In my dispute letter which will be attached to this complaint, I respectfully requested that I was exercising my legal right under the FCRA ( Fair Credit Reporting Act ) to have this account fully investigated with factual and verifiable facts as I had no idea of this account being placed with this compan y by Wells Fargo Ba nk.     Shortly thereafter I contac ted Wells Fargo via phone with their customer service department. After numerous transfers to one department to another, several conversations and total time of 2.27 ( 2 hours and 27 minutes  of phone conversation ), ; the rep verbally told me that there were nothing showing up under my personal information and to wait until I receive the dispute back to go any further.     Hurt and confused, I waited anxiously until I heard back from  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX . Letter from  XXXX  was dated  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  ( see attached lette r ) T he letter was very vague at best and it stated that "" the information confirms that the information in your file is accurate and complete as of the date it was furnished to our database ''. There was no information from  Wells Fargo  or  XXXX   XXXX  Services on how it was disputed such as : Who they spoke too? What personal information do they have of mine insuring it belonged to me? Was this account showing accurate on the date in question? Was my signature on any documents? What was the account closed for? Why was I never notified regarding this account? Several other questions WAS NOT ANSWERED! Not documents were from  Wells Fargo s howing this account. No documents were attached to this super vague letter results letter.     So again I contact  XXXX  to ask about the above questions and was given even more vague answers. They would NOT PROVIDE ME ANY DOCUMENTS ON HOW THEY VERIFIED THS WI TH WELLS FARGO BAN K. I spoke to several reps at this company including an supervisor to no avail! They just instructed me to submit an "" rebuttal statement '' and they will attach it to my file. I was furious and not going to accept this.     Since I had already contacted  Wells Fargo via telephone, I decided to go IN PERSON to my local branch to discuss this with either a customer service banker or Branch Manger. I just wanted this settled a nd taken care of immediately.     I went into the branch and spoke to a CSSR   XXXX   XXXX   (  XXXX , NC  branch ) and  after showing her my personal documents such as Drivers License and Social Security Number card, I told her what I was going through. After verifying who I was, she looked over my documents as to see where to start with my issue. She used my personal information to find me in their system and COULD NOT FIND ME IN  THIER DATA BASE. S he then used my other personal documents that I PROVIDED AND OFFERED TO HER WITHOUT QUESTION. After several attempts of trying to locate me, she did find an old IRA w ith Wells Fargo bu t nothing was showing under that account.

After all is was supposed to be in  XXXX  OVER 5 YEARS AGO.     One department she was transferred to did finally find this account with account stated above. The department head discussed with us this was an old account back in  XXXX  and they were I QUOTE THIS "" not actively pursuing this account due to the length of time frame that had expired ''. That did n't make sense to me. If they were n't actively pursuing me for this erroneous account, then why would they place this account with  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX . This account was an old account that was closed by me. No further contact was given to me that anything was an issue with this account.     Now after almost another couple of hours with the  CSSR at Wells Fargo, I was   instructed to contact the next day as to "" awake this account '' and an telephone contact number to use. The very next morning I contacted this department with the information that was given to me that previous day. After several attempts of different departments, I finally got to a customer rep who stated the very same statement to me as was given to us ( myself and the CSSR ) quote- 'we are not actively pursing this account due to the length of time that had expired '' and "" that this account was closed ''.   So again I was instructed to contact  XXXX  and/or go back to the branch to discuss this further.     I am now at my wits end and so frustrated that I have been given the run around for a 5 YEAR CLOSED ACCOUNT from  Wells Fargo bank and nothing can be done. Now I ask : *Why cant this account just be  deleted off  XXXX  via  Wells Fargo Bank by  contacting   XXXX   and demanding the removal?     *Why was I never notified that there was any issue regarding this old closed account?      *If Wells Fargo is n't activ ely pursi ng this 5 YEAR OLD closed account, why must my good name and character be punished? Statue of limitations apply to this as necessary.          For the amount of time, energy and frustration I have been going through for almost a month ; this has got to be taken care of.

I accepted the offer and did qualify according to  XXXX   XXXX . I supplied all the required documents to further process my refinance loan. During the transaction  XXXX   XXXX  was able to retrieve my  credit score  and upon qualifying he made a request for a payment to conduct my appraisal. In turn, I gave him my visa credit card on  XXXX   XXXX ,    2017.    Later, I received a call as I was assigned to Loan  Specialist   XXXX   XXXX  who took over, and summarized my business dealing had with  XXXX   XXXX  but more importantly, I expressed the conversation regarding the waiver of my escrow proposed by  XXXX   XXXX .  ( if  my appraisal was higher than {$260000.00} his company would wave my escrow ).  XXXX   XXXX  said I should remind her at the end. Following our conversation a week after, I received a call from  XXXX   XXXX  the Friday before  XXXX  weekend following up with me. On  XXXX   XXXX ,  2017   XXXX   XXXX  said they placed an order for my title. In addition, she mentioned, my application was in under writing.

There were numinous errors pertaining to my loan request on my application, amount of assets, purpose written as an equity loan meanwhile the offer is only for mortgage or refinance loan.

I initially contacted Wells Fargo because they have a special program for teachers as listed on the teachers ' union website. I wanted to get a loan estimate that I could use to compare and shop around with other refinancing offers. After talking to a Wells Fargo representative for over an hour and reviewing costs, he offered to send me a loan estimate. But in order to proceed, he said that I had to pay {$510.00} for a credit report and appraisal. I told him that I did not feel comfortable paying the money without having time to review the loan estimate first. It was early evening and he told me that the rate would not be guaranteed and that we would have to start all over if I waited until the morning to review the loan estimate. Against my better judgement, I gave him my credit card information for payment. I had more trust in the company since they were recommended by the union. In addition, my XXXX year old daughter had been crying about eating dinner and I needed to end the call, but did n't want to have to start all over again. The next day I still felt uncomfortable about the fact that they demanded so much money upfront without giving me the opportunity to review the loan estimate. I decided to call another bank just to compare numbers and they ended up giving me a loan estimate without any upfront payments and ended up being significantly cheaper. I realized at that point I had been lied to about having to pay the money upfront since the other bank made no such requirement to review the loan estimate. I went on the Consumer Finance Bureau 's website and it says, "" You can be charged a credit report fee before receiving a GFE. But, you ca n't be charged any other fees until you get the GFE and indicate that you want to proceed with the mortgage loan. '' Wells Fargo did charge me additional fees -- the cost of the appraisal -- before giving me the opportunity of reviewing the loan estimate. By saying I had to give them money at that moment or else the loan estimate would be void, was deceptive and used to get me to go with them after paying such a large down payment. 

They also had the appraiser call me immediately to schedule an appraisal, which is another tactic used to prevent me from shopping around. I realize I made a mistake by not trusting my instinct, but these practices are deceptive and should be banned. 
As a result, I was charged {$510.00} even though I am not using Wells Fargo to refinance my loan.",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As you should know, a growing number of state and federal lawmakers, candidates for office, news outlets and social media have an interest in discussing the "" underbelly '' of the financial markets, including debt collectors like Bank of America Home Loans. I am committed to encouraging and shaping such discussions. 

In or about XX/XX/XXXX, my family notified your employer that I was hospitalized with a severe, traumatic-brain injury.

This was a new branch that had recently opened nearby to where I was working at the time. I was growing dissatisfied with XXXX XXXX ( my main financial institution over the last 15 years ) over some new fees they were charging me so I had been shopping around, trying various other banks in the area ( and one or two online ) looking for a product that suited my needs. Union Bank fit the bill due to this XXXX XXXX branch being near to my work and having another branch not far from my home. When I opened the account, the banker told me about a current promotion they were running, awarding a {$200.00} bonus for opening a new checking account at that branch [ please see page 1 of the attached PDF. ] Pleasantly surprised at my luck, I found out the details and we opened the account. The promotion stipulated that the account must receive a direct deposit of greater than {$250.00} or make five debit card purchases or payments. After opening the account, I had my employer change my direct deposit to the Union Bank checking account and a deposit of {$250.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX.
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter [ see page 2 of the attached PDF ] on Union Bank letterhead from the Deposit Fraud Department of a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX, a "" member '' of MUFG ( the global financial group that Union Bank, N.A. is a subsidiary of ) stating that they would be closing my account in one week ( XX/XX/XXXX ) due to information they received from XXXX ( they did not specify what information exactly ) and that my funds on deposit would be mailed to me in the form of a cashier 's check no later than five business days after the date of closure. I called the number listed in the letter ( XXXX ) to inform this Deposit Fraud Department that there was no fraud, that it was indeed me that opened this account and to see what information they needed to verify that fact so that it could be reopened right away. The phone was answered by a fairly rude customer service representative. He informed me that the department 's decision to close the account was not due to suspected fraud as I had concluded after reading the letter, but due to the fact that I had opened two checking accounts in the two weeks following opening the account with Union Bank. I informed him that I was not fully satisfied with Union Bank and that I was in the process of trialling a few new banks after having banked with XXXX for so long. I do not recall precisely whether he asked me to elaborate on why I was not fully satisfied with Union Bank but specifically I had problems with Union Bank 's policy of charging fees on transfers to external financial institutions, their slow ACH transfer time and their relatively low monthly and daily limits on these transfers, not to mention the monthly checking account fee. None of this mattered ; apparently Union Bank 's decision was final. The representative could not speculate as to whether I was "" banned for life '' or not. I asked because I was finding it hard to believe what was happening as nowhere in their disclosures or terms and conditions was it stipulated that Union Bank a jealous lover that would close your account if it caught you fooling around with another suitor. I found the whole conversation with the representative from the Deposit Fraud Department to be absurd in the end. This is America after all, and in America the consumer enjoys the right of free trade, the freedom to choose whom he or she decides to do business with. Union Bank 's policy seems anti-business and anti-America for that matter. If they are so worried about what other banks a customer may be doing business with, perhaps they should focus on improving their products instead so that their customers do n't have good reasons to look elsewhere.",Referral to partner agency,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

I have been diligently trying to correspond via email with First Citizens Bank. The difference that is owed should not exceed about or an estimated XXXX dollars. When I spoke with XXXX the Branch advisor she told me to ignore the letters that were coming in the mail that I would have enough time to adjust reverse payments and also transfer money into the account. I explained that I would no longer be banking with First Citizens Bank because this was a huge error on their part and they did not want write a letter clarifying the issues.",NFA,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

Bankruptcy and a student loan. After speaking with the Student loan department they told that the account was closed and taking over by another company which i knew already because i had sent the form in to Equifax dispute department to remove the old account of the student loan. Some guy got on the phone and read of some account number that didnt belong to me and refused to delete the items from my credit report. The bk is 7 yrs old and was filed under a lawyer who banned from practice and the put the filing void status. They where very unprofessional and did not follow the law of dispute. I specifically asked them to tsend me proof of the results of my disputes and they felled to do and does not want to delete inaccurate information on my credit report. This matter has put alot of stress on my and as im trying to finance a home. And to have a credit bureau of such handling your credit file is heart breaking.

My travel plan started in  XXXX  to visit my family in  XXXX   XXXX  whom I did not see for four years now.   In  XXXX , I called  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and  XXXX   XXXX  and both said they do not issue visas for   XXXX   XXXX   ( which I am ). So me and my family decided to meet in  XXXX  instead.   In  XXXX  early morning, I booked the flight from  XXXX   XXXX  to  XXXX  through  XXXX   XXXX  for {$740.00} Same day,  XXXX   XXXX , I hear about a friend who is a  XXXX  (   XXXX   XXXX   lives in USA like me ) who was processed a visa to  XXXX  through  XXXX   XXXX  in  XXXX . I called them and asked them why did you tell me that you dont process   XXXX   XXXX    last month? The lady who answered the phone was like no thats not true we do process visas for   XXXX   XXXX   and you can do it through the website. She also said that you have to book the ticket first before you can apply. I asked her if there are any restrictions on applying? She said NO as long as you dont live in  XXXX  you should be fine. I was like ok lets do it ( at this point I accepted the charges was willing to pay the change fee ). She changed my reservation from  XXXX   XXXX  to  XXXX  to be  XXXX   XXXX  to  XXXX  and I had to pay {$330.00}. I went ahead and submitted a visa application through their website, and for the  visa  fees they did not accep  t AMEX card so I had to use MasterCard for the fees.
three day  s later I receive an email from  XXXX  ( the visa processing company of emirates airlines ) saying that my visa was denied and no reasons were stated nor official documents provided. (  XXXX  actually refunded the visa application fee because they did not provide any government official documents about the denial of the application, so  XXXX  refunded the visa fees ) I called the airline again saying why the heck did you make go through all of this if you have restrictions? They replied with I am just an employee here and I can only tell you what I have on the system.   ( My family found out later that only   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   citizens   can be granted    XXXX    visa  something that  XXXX   XXXX  did not mention although I asked if any restrictions apply ) I was forced to pay additional {$420.00} to change my ticket back to be  XXXX   XXXX  to  XXXX .   ( in both cases the charge was like {$300.00} ticket change fee plus fare price difference ).   I was preparing to travel, I bought all the gifts and got everything ready including Apartment and Car Rental in  XXXX .    XXXX    XXXX   issues a travel ban affecting me  (  as  a Green Card holder  from  XXXX  ). My lawyer called me and told me if you leave you are not entering back to the United States. This forced me to cancel all my reservations. As you notice on the account,  XXXX  and  XXXX  actually refunded me all my money.   I called   XXXX   XXXX   explaining them what happened and call center refused to refund anything. I submitted a refund request form on their website attaching the  XXXX  ban, few days later I receive an email saying well refund you {$170.00}. I noticed on their website they issued a statement saying that they will refund all those affected by the travel ban. I replied to the person who sent me the email with the link and asking them why only {$170.00} and I received no reply.   The link to  XXXX   XXXX  website where they stated about the travel ban refund :   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX  UPDATE : on    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX        XXXX   removed the statement about the refund but we can still access it using a   XXXX   XXXX   website ( a website that makes a copy of other websites based on date ) Refund note Screenshot here :   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     XXXX  click on the  XXXX   XXXX  it should take you to :   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   Summary : If you notice there are  two  parts to these disputes, the costs of changes are because of the    XXXX    visa  refusal which I asked and made sure that there are no restrictions on   XXXX   XXXX   before I applied and as I mentioned the answer was if you live outside of  XXXX  then no restrictions.   The final cancellation was caused by  XXXX  travel ban which  XXXX   XXXX  made a statement about and they said they will refund those who are affected.

Citibank immediatly went back and decided the dispute against me and took the permanent credit BACK FROM ME AND CAUSED MY CHECKING ACCOUNT TO BE IN THE NEGATIVE. I did not discover this until XXXX/XXXX/15, when I received the letter fromCitibank. In tears, I immediatly called Citibank fraud supervisors, immediatly, explained my situation and begged for my credit to be placed back in my account. They refused. They each and all were highly emphatic, to the point of sadistically uncooperative and unwilling to make ANY AMENDS OR SO MUCH AS AN EXCEPTION TO HELP ME, A LOYAL CUSTOMER. I went into the bank, politely, urging the branch staff to help me. Staff made a few calls to administrative staff, but intentionally and falsely put me in a bad light and, in the end, told me, in so many words, to go XXXX, and stated that they would NOT help me. I then Appealed the case/dispute and faxed in my Appeal that very same day.

But XXXX XXXX had banned from the bank, so what was I supposed to do? They had put my account in the negative, due to their own cheating and incompetence, lack of cooperation, sadistic mistreatment of their customer, then had me banned.

The lender was Fl based EverBank XXXX credit scores were XXXX, Loan/Value was & lt ; 50 % XXXX debt servie ratios were & lt ; 10 % of income. Simple loan. I was told to bring a bank check to the closing at their title company 's office in XXXX XXXX. No problem. I brought a cashier 's check drawn on my Federally insured XXXX based credit Union ( with over {$XXXX} XXXX XXXX ). I was told that they would n't accept the check because it would take 2 weeks to clear ( obviously not true, with image cash letter technology, it clears overnight or faster ). And, as you well know Official bank checks have been commonly used for residential mortgage closings for decades. So I had to get a wire out of my of my credit union. Big surprise and not easy! The incompetence of the EverBank and its title company turned what should have been a XXXX minute closing into a XXXX hour ordeal.. At the time I decided that I am going to get as far away from EverBank as fast as possible. Over the last 3 months I found that to be way more difficicult than it should be. In XXXX I wanted to make a $ XXXX payment via ACH. It was rejected ( no ACH payments over {$9900.00} allowed ). I called to see if they would accept a wire. Of course not, I had to send a payment by check to a special address. Great! I followed the instructions, but it took a week from the time I mailed it until the time it got posted to my mortgage. Looks to me that they take their time posting checks, so from then on I sent checks USPS Overnight Mail, Return receipt. In XXXX I sent a check larger than the loan balance and one week later I received the check back in the mail with a form letter and a box checked : "" X Personal/ business checks not accepted for payoff ''. Obviously they want to continue accruing interest for as much and as long as possible. So I immediately sent a check for {$1000.00} less than the XXXX they mailed back, which they posted. Little did they know or care that the first check ( the XXXX they returned ) had to be posted as required by Federal Banking Law ( Reg Z prompt crediting rules, as recently amended per the requirements of Dodd Frank ). By the way banks have been posting checks promptly in that situation for decades. Now I am trying to pay off the remaing {$1000.00} which you think should be easy. After all I have about {$9000.00} in escrow funds, XXXX the loan balance. The escrow balance is so high because they forced me to start the escrow with $ XXXX even though the Homeowners Ins was fully paid for one year prior to closing and the real estate taxes was paid ahead over six months. Why not just take it out of the huge escrow balance and send me a check for the remaining escrow balance ( $ XXXX ). There is no way that these trained obstuctionists ever due any thing that simple or customer friendly. Currenly I am awaiting a form in the mail for a payoff. Of course, they want an official check or a wire to pay off the loan. It is very difficult wading through a mass of undisclosed rules that have no basis inlaw, finance or logic. The lesson to be learned here in XXXX with EverBank. Thes guys give bankers a bad name and should be banned from the mortgage banking business. I take some blame for not doing research on line on this company ( apparently a widely hated institution ). I incorrectly assumed that a {$22.00} XXXX Bank could handle a simple transaction competently and ethically. I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

I did however, notice that the account had been removed from Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX and from from XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX.  This was great news, but short lived. The company immediately re-inserted the account now as a new collector - XXXX, XXXX/XXXX, with a new address - no longer in XXXX, XXXX but XXXX, XXXX and a new account number. This was now showing as a new collection account and had a very dramatic negative impact on my profile, my ability to gain vital financing for my business, and ultimately my personal and family finances. <P/>This re-insertion was done unlawfully as the consumer was not notified within 5 days of the re-insertion to my report. I sent a re-insertion letter to XXXX and the three bureaus to dispute the re-insertion and requested that they comply with the provisions of FCRA SOS 611, Procedure in case of disputed accuracy [ 15 U.S.C.

I am currently XXXX in XXXX XXXX, and PNC decides to freeze my account ( on XXXX XXXX, 2017 ). A larger than usual CASH deposit was made to my account on Wednesday the XXXX, and immediately after I saw it was cleared I went to use the ATMs here to withdraw in order to pay my rent and bills. My card was rejected. I was able to put in my pin and everything, but at the end of the transaction the machine would just spit out the card without an error message. This card is in perfect condition and I have been using PNC over here for 6 years and this has never happened before. The only other people that have access to my account are my parents in the states, and they made that deposit before their 20 day trip to XXXX. I immediately contacted our representative at the XXXX Branch and went through an exchange of emails and phone calls. XXXX is very kind and I honestly believe she was doing everything she could. No explanation could be found why my card was working. I honestly lost track after this how many people I talked to. Thursday, XXXX XXXX and rent and bills are due. I call again different departments. They all tell me they are so sorry, there is nothing they can do. They ask me how old is my card? Is it damaged? No, my card is in perfect condition, and this problem only happened after the bigger deposit. The suspicious thing is every time I would say this to any representative they would all say "" Oh, hmm ... Well lets look into some other things. '' Now I have no idea why PNC would want to keep my funds from me right after a larger deposit was made, but I know it has to be illegal. Hours and hours of calls, transferred from one department to the next only to have them all tell me "" I 'm so so sorry, there 's nothing we can do. '' I had to explain the whole ordeal over and over again, there is ZERO communication between departments! <P/>I started to reach out to their XXXX Help Acct and was given numbers to the escalated departments. I had a weird feeling, but I called into the Phone Banking System only to find my Phone Banking Pin HAD BEEN CHANGED! I emailed my representative right away and had her make sure my pins were set to the ones I set them to. Hopeful, I went out to the ATMs yet again, only to have the card rejected. I tried ATM after ATM, all different banks, and the same exact thing happened at every single one. This made it apparent that it was n't a problem over here, but with PNC, even though PNC started blaming the ATMs over here. I should also tell you that I am living in a small poor port town, ATMs are very spread out and far. Exhausted and frustrated, I reached out to a friend in the XXXX. We planned that I would transfer ALL my funds to her XXXX XXXX XXXX Acct and she would then be able to XXXX XXXX me the funds. Come to find out it takes 3 Business Days for transfers to outside banks. My friend then goes into an actual branch and speaks to someone who says "" Oh that help department is just closing. '' She then asks if she can even open an account only to allow me to transfer her the funds. Apparently it was not possible for her to open an account until she had paperwork that she would have to bring the next day. At this point I was starting to panic. <P/>The only options I was given during this whole ordeal was to have a new card sent out ( maybe it will arrive in a week?! I am in XXXX XXXX! ), to use XXXX app, which DOES NOT WORK WITH MY SAVINGS ACCOUNT, or to XXXX XXXX the funds to myself, WHICH ALSO DOES NOT WORK WITH A SAVINGS ACCOUNT! I have spoken to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, but I am sure there are more that I cant remember. <P/>Friday, XXXX XXXX and still nothing. I am starting to run low on my XXXX XXXX medication and also on food, toilet paper and drinking water ( ca n't drink the tap here! ). I have now missed 1 class and almost missed work. With no food my medical condition worsens and I become XXXX, so I reach out to a friend over here and beg for enough money to get something to eat so I do n't end up in the hospital. I continue making calls, while XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX start to happen and I start becoming incredibly XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I speak to the Escalated Department. Same thing, they are so sorry and there is nothing they can do. I reach out to another friend in the states and luckily her family has PNC! I should n't have gotten my hopes up. IT TAKES 3 BUSINESS DAYS TO TRANSFER FROM ONE PNC ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER! IT IS THE SAME BANK!!! So the funds would not go through until Wednesday! When I call and ask why this is, I got a snappy response and was told "" That 's how our wiring system is. '' Unbelievable. My friend with the PNC account and I do a conference call to the escalated department, and she is there more for moral support so I do n't completely break down. I also want it to be known I was incredibly kind to every representative and patient with them, I guess they took advantage of that. We speak with XXXX because XXXX was not in, and after the same conversations, same being put on hold, same "" I 'm so sorry ma'am I do n't know why this is happening. '' He then told us that if my friend went into the branch she could ask for the transfer to be expedited if she says it is an open case. We try to plan for this, but she has work early until after the banks are closed, so I ask if I can transfer myself the funds using XXXX XXXX. I am told Yes! So again I 'm hopeful this can be resolved. <P/>Saturday, XXXX XXXX, still nothing. I go onto the website for XXXX XXXX only to find out that they do n't even accept wire transfers from savings accounts!!! So I was straight out lied to by PNC. I am guessing PNC 's goal is to exhaust their customers into giving up and then they get to steal their customers ' money. A friend is able to XXXX XXXX me enough for food for a couple days ... Now I know this part is n't PNC 's fault, but just that day XXXX XXXX was closed due to a system error, I took a picture with the date. At this point I am laughing at how terrible and unbelievable this whole situation is. I go to try my card at another ATM just in case by some miracle it is working again. I video record what happens, same thing, the card gets spit out. <P/>It is now XXXX XXXX. My XXXX XXXX medication and other medication will run out tomorrow. My rent is late and so are my bills. I wo n't be able to get any money until Wednesday IF my money transfers to another account successfully and someone can take it out and XXXX XXXX it to me. Not once has PNC called or reached out to me. I started to warn others on social media and WAS WARNED BY PNC THAT REPEATED COMMENTS CAN HAVE ME BANNED FROM THE COMMUNITY. They have the nerve to threaten to take me out of their community!!! I should also mention on Thursday I was given a very strange identity test to confirm I was who i said I was ... I have no idea why this was done. It was a multiple choice XXXX question test, I did audio record this. I was given options and was shocked when I found out they knew the name of my ex boyfriend I had in XXXX and that I lived in XXXX in XXXX!!! I was not only crushed and losing hope, but now fairly disturbed. When I told the representative "" Oh my XXXX! How could you know this?! '' she laughed and said "" Haha I know! The system ( ca n't remember the name but it is on tape ) know everything! '' I still have no way to access my own money, with Wednesday it will be a week with no money. Having to borrow {$10.00} here and there begging friends because MY OWN BANK IS WITHHOLDING MY OWN MONEY FROM ME! <P/>PLEASE ANYONE READING THIS! DO N'T USE THIS BANK! I do n't want anyone else to have to go through this. So here I am, stuck in XXXX XXXX, with no money and now late rent and bills. I have never ever been late for bills or rent and I pride myself on that ... first time for everything thanks to PNC. Oh, I also had to laugh when the representatives told me to go into a branch.

My complaint is that I was just informed by my current mortgage lender,  XXXX   XXXX , that  Flagstar  did process my modification under  HAMP  after I asked for a Payoff quote. It appears that since my interest was n't lowered, years added to loan for a total of 40 years, and deferred principal amount of {$26000.00}, Flagstar merely completed a streamline loan modification.

First checking account opened in   XXXX   XXXX  , and closed in   XXXX   XXXX  , by my request. During the years I would encounter unauthorized or unknown charges in the range of $  XXXX  {$150.00 } ( once or twice per year ). The dispute process would take 3-5 da ys or more to reverse these charges back to my account, though I would not face a hard time in proving they were false or security breached. Each time  US Ban k would apologize for any inconvenience, though they would repeatedly happen over and over. That 's why I closed it, and reopened a new account with the same  US Bank - big  mistake, should have switched to another bank. The first couple of years I did not see anymore strange or unauthorized activities, until   XXXX   XXXX  , and this time it wa s US Bank its elf aledging some ghost money I owed them, for which they were never able to prove documents or statements, other than what the system tells them, which is a very short phrase : "" charged Off/PMT ''. In   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    US Bank debits my c urrent savings account with them, in the amount of {$340.00}. I asked why?, and they stated I owed them from that checking account I had closed in    XXXX   . I had several phone conversations and in a branch in person, also requesting statements or some kind of document to prove that I owed the charges, but there was no prove. Within a couple days, continuing my determination, I say I was lucky to speak with a  US Bank  wise manager, and she could not explain or find statements either, and realized it was an unauthorized charge from the recove ry dept.,  and with friendly apologies she reversed the charge of {$340.00} back to my account with in 24 hou rs. Things kept going well, until   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  .  US Bank de bits my checking account this time in much higher $ $ amounts, totaling {$770.00}, plus several overdraft charges of at le ast 4 or 5, becau se of their forced debits that deducted all the available $ $ amount from my checking account. I spent all day with phone conversations and stope d to two diff erent branches. The only answers I got from  one of them was only the w ord of mouth that I owe  US Bank all the se money, and the other was able to print me a statement from my closed account in   XXXX   and which makes it even more bizarre for their training or specialty as Bank customer service, is that the statement was declaring {$0.00} balance right in front of their eyes. Still, no one was able to give me a statement or letter, or any documents that showed I owed the amount of money that  US Bank  had charged me, and no one could reverse or dispute any of them. However,  Most of t hem were nice, I could understand they did not have control over their system, or did they? They also mentioned to me another charged off account which remains a ghost, since I did not have it! and they could not print me a statement or document to show the charges. What made it even more scary as of now by the end of the day, is that an agress ive manager from the  recovery dept. stated that : "" you still owe more money to  US Bank starting  from {$99.00} and up '' for which he could not disclose the total, but said : "" we will continue to debit your checking and savings account anytime we find a suporting balance, unauthorized and without notice just like we did it previously, and the charges would vary anywhere from {$100.00} to {$500.00}, as it seams fit t o US Bank. An d do not expect any statements or documents from us. We will only send you a leter to tell you how much you still owe us, but no details of what for, and no details on what we already charged you ''. At this point, I could hardly believe what I was listening to, it really seamed like  one of those scary scams that unlicensed and illegal businesses practice. Well, this came directly from US Bank  itself. Certainly I 'm overwhelmed, but because this is the first day for me which came as a shock, but it absolutely will go through a very detailed investigation, most likely through a law suit. No statements or No documents to prove the forced unauthorized charges is certainly in my favor. However, it will take sometime to take the money back, which so far is close to {$1000.00}, and could go even higher in days, if the fraud practices that the  US Bank representative stated are true. Or perhaps I may find another wise manager to reverse these forced charges back to my account. ( Highly doubt though, who knows ) I better take out some cash before US Bank steal it all.

There was a previous complaint #  XXXX , which did not include items covered here. Comments on the lette r ( not sent to me ) but to the  CFPB by  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  are included. Additional reference documents are also included with this complaint.  PNC B ank has not provided common information requested, assistance through channels they directed me and my family to, has posed risks to my, my wifes and our family accounts including SS and insurance. Through failure to properly allow me to make deposits, use my checking, and investment accounts, credit risks were posed. For many months ending  with PNC Banks closure of several accounts, I, and my wife had not been able to obtain committed advice, or direction from PNC Bank representatives as required in their agreements for these accounts. Clo sures were well from  12 to 30 days, as there were holidays and weekends involved, ( se e attached ) below any reasonable number expected for major account funds transfers. Even the closure notices are inconsistent. The note from  XXXX   XXXX , dated  XXXX   XXXX  ( received on or about  XXXX   XXXX  gives notice of account  XXXX  closure by  XXXX   XXXX . This is less than 12 days. This first notice was shortly after  PNC representatives would not provide assistance. This is retaliatory, noting else. Is this proper or fair treatment? Commitments by designated PNC B ank contact,  XXXX   XXXX , after the CFPB complaint have not been completed and summary statements posed b y PNC to C FPB and others are absolutely false and defamatory. Related to  XXXX , the  PNC Branch manager, aggre ssive behavior was shown by him, on  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX . Details are included below and in an attachment. The forgery of documents claims are founded, counter to  XXXX   XXXX  statement. I will make myself available at any time to undergo handwriting analysis to compare my known signature to those poste d. One ob vious example is attached. When  XXXX   XXXX , the investment advisor involved, was originally approached of the forgeries, he noted that the signatures must have been done by someone at the corporate level. He fully agreed they were not mine. Comment was made by me that forgery is a bad habit-no matter who did it. When a representati ve of PNC  Bank itself has agreed, this hardly matches  XXXX   XXXX  unfounded comment on forgery. Direct testimony by  XXXX   XXXX  should have been enough to convinc e PNC tha t something major was wrong. Statements otherwise now by  XXXX   XXXX  or any others are completely false and do not match the real documents.   Failure to Assist and Provide Information on Special Loan Offer The letter from  XXXX   XXXX  states that the accounts were closed because of consistent and repeated instances of aggressive behavior at the  XXXX   XXXX . Branch. This is totally and absolutely false. I have never had any confrontation with any regula r PNC bankin g representative. On or about  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , nearly a year ago, I had requested directly from the available local branch  PNC Investment Representative copies of ALL signed documents in PNC files for myself and my wife. The request was made due to an ongoing issue related to forgery of documents by PNC. A copy of one forged item is attached. The document copies were to include all in PNC files. She agreed, with no questions, with an expectati on within a few days. A reference is in the attached  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  note to  XXXX   XXXX . Some investment documents including forgeries were provided. Many others were not. This failure showed an unacceptable lack of respect and common banking courtesy. Multiple accounts were open at that time, with many signature documents available  in PNC records. Since an issue related to a forgery by PNC had already gone on for  an extended time, I was rightly disappointed. A request for a follow up call from  XXXX , the bank  manager  was not completed. This matched a previous pattern from PNC. There has been no refusal by me for assistance. None has been offered. Through the year, I continued to regularly visit the same near by PNC branc h location for checking, credit card, savings, and other banking/investment needs. At all times, the regular staff treated me professionally and courteously. I extended the same respect. To state there were repeated instances is a fabrication. On nearly all visits, a bag of candy id given to tellers or representatives. There have been no other instances related to my personal conduct. This does not match  XXXX   XXXX  statements. Further, the sentence that I refused in any way to allow  PNCI  representatives help me with investment account is also completely false. My repeated requests have been ignored. An offer was made by me to travel to any other location, including  XXXX  or  XXXX  to obtain advice ( see  XXXX  visit report ). Follow up requests were completely ignored. I challenge anyone to prove otherwise. Comments on the pending  XXXX  complaint and any investment issue were completely avoided. Through the actual closures, regular banking transactions continued. On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  the statement by  XXXX  was that no one was to speak to me. Please read the attached summary of the  XXXX   XXXX  visits. The only thing which has been consistent is the failure of  PNC and  its top banking representatives to complete its commitments or assist. Other accounts remain open. A complaint on forgery to the Alabama  Securities Commission ( ASC ) co ntinues on  Page   XXXX  of  XXXX  its own. The note from  XXXX   XXXX  dated  XXXX   XXXX  has her phone number for contact Phone and e-mail requests to speak or answer questions have been completely ignored. Record of  one  such attempt is attached. Is this fairly and equally?   Unprofessional Conduct b y PNC Bank Branch Manager On   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , I entered th e PNC Ba nk branch in  XXXX , Alabama to receive account information, and secure funds, as my work had been reduced. Many accounts were open. I had done business at that location for over 29 ye ars ( own ership has changed ). Regular statements referred me to  XXXX   XXXX  for advice.  XXXX   XXXX  had been involved with the complaint to  the ASC Commission. Co ntacting him was not allowed per earlier written notice  from PNC b ank. Calls to the other recommended representatives were not answered. The investment call center was then contacted. The need for advice and this situation were explained. They recommended I visit the local branch and contact other investment advisors. This left me and my family in a quandary. Per this direction, a visit was made to the local branch. The notes o n 3  visits extending from  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  are attached. In summary, follow up on the fir st two vis its was not completed. My requests were ignored. On the third attempt,  XXXX , the ban k manager refused to assist, offered no other direction, noted that no one at PNC was to speak to me, made other unrelated negative comments and asked me to leave his office. This conduct by PNC was unprofessional and provocative. None of t his matches a note from  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  on any actions by me. Statements to agencies by  PNC have not mentioned this incident, or the insult it posed to me and my family. As no assistance was going to be provided, other banking decisions were made outside of PNC. This incident, and previous conduct by PNC does not match a banking institution which states help was offered but was not accepted. Throughout, I have remained patient, and abiding. PNC Bank then chose to punitively close my and my wifes chec king account, savings and investment accounts.   Repeated Attempts to Information and Answers to Inquiries On numerous occasions, before the actual closures, I attempted to secure in an y PNC directed way provided, additional information from PNC Bank. The only answers given from the DRU/Positive Balance Account Closure number (   XXXX   ) were (  in so many words ) : You have a right to close an account at any time you want, and we can too. Such comments should never be tolerated. As I had and retain a credit card thro ugh PNC Bank,  I have continued my regular at branch in bank payments of this balance. During none of those visits, nor during visits for an organization for which I am treasurer or for other needs were there any negative comments by any  PNC staff. There was always a welcoming, atmosphere by tellers and assistants. This never changed. Only my, and my wifes checking account and some others were closed. These closures were selective, were unwarranted, were attempts by PNC to be punitive and were made to cause as much disruption as PNC felt it coul d to my regular banking activities.   Formal Offer of a Reduced Rate Loan after Closure Notices-Lack of Response On  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , after all account closure notices, but before final closures on  XXXX   XXXX , a personal mail offer was received by me to obtain a low interest home loan, as a part of a pre-selected offer. A much lower rate would be required if automatic payment was made from checking.  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , my designated CFPB Complaint contact, was informed by phone and by e-mail.  XXXX  agreed to provide information and advice with recommended actions, including possibly opening a new checking account, or receiving an extension to the timetable, to take advantage of the offer. The date for the end of the offer,  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , was well after actual checking account closure. A copy of the loan offer and my requests for information are attached. Answers were never provided.  If PNC h ad any concern about me, as noted in the response to CFPB complaint #  XXXX  or had any issues whatsoever, why was this special pre-selected offer made? Shou ld PNC possibly comment now that this was by another group is totally ignorant of documented fact. Commitments for common courtesy responses, when proper recommended channels have been followed should have been completed. Most would agree it appears PNC had continued a selective, one sided punitive effort toward me, my wife, and my family. This, by any reason is directly linked to the ASC complaint. All related PNC actions toward me an d my family are unprofessional, unethical, and unacceptable according to regular banking practices.   Summary Due to the fact tha t PNC had not made any attempt to assist me or my wife with my banking requests, had noted that it was up to us to move forward on my own, that preferred checking account linked loan offers were made but not allowed, that simple courtesies were not fulfilled, and for other documented reasons, I find an additional CFPB complaint against PNC conduct to be necessary. Response to Page   XXXX  of  XXXX  any previous CFPB complaints  by PNC are in correct. In a conversation with  XXXX   XXXX , after her review of the  XXXX  furnished pages of documents to her, she stated every attempt would be made to be fair to me, to provide me directly with all response information, to retain accounts if at all possible, and to complete an open and balanced investigation.  XXXX   XXXX  completely understood and agreed with my frustration. She noted that behavior of the branc h manager I d escribed was unacceptable.  XXXX   XXXX  noted that on first review there appeared to be a discrepancy in the ( forged  ) si gnatures. On this we totally agreed. She also inferred that based on her investigation, the accounts should be reopened, and she would recommend this. This is not the directio n PNC chose.  Her letter statements are  XXXX  degrees from this. No questions were ever raised or comments made on any personal negative behavior, including a singular  XXXX   XXXX  visit when  PNC  failed to furnish expected documents. I noted earlier how I had and continue to show personal courtesies to the tellers. For many years, this has created and continues a very positive relationship with no issues. The decisions against me, toward my wife and my family  may have been made at a higher bank management level. A complaint to the ASC on forgery was only as a last resort, and was related to long going lack of answers from PNC.  Retaliatory actions, closing accounts with very short notice, and false statements to the CFPB require counter comment.   Linkag e of ASC Complaint to Closure of  Accounts  PNC has not fulfilled its promises and has acted in an unfair way to cause harm to me, my wife, and my family. The closures and complaint on forgery appear linked. Just because a bank can do something it feels will be punitive does not justify it. PNC has been intentionally vindictive. Statements to the CFPB are false or full misrepresentations. Federal Banking Agencies, the State of Alabama, the public, inve stors, and account holders have commitments b y PNC, as a public trust not to perform in this way. My family and I hope further investigation, and review of the attached documents by the ASC, PNC and the CFPB determines answers. To date, none have been provided. Reference docume nts are included with this complaint. Thank you on behalf of the individual banker and investor.   Respectfully,  XXXX   XXXX ,",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,,0,3,0

XX/XX/XXXX   - I called to follow up on the account application that seemed to be taking too long. I was asked some questions about the source of funding and told things should be moving along.       XX/XX/XXXX  - Account still not opened so I called again and was told "" almost ''  XX/XX/XXXX  - Account opened and received welcome letter Note : If we use  XX/XX/XXXX     as the account opening date, I 'll have to meet  1 of the 2 r equirements for the bonus before   XX/XX/XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX  -  Account gets funded with a transfer in from another financial institution where I also have an account.

I wa s content to wait until that date and perhaps a bit beyond.     In earl y  XX/XX/XXXX  upo n logging into my HSBC account I was presented with a message that I had not completed the requirements of the bonus offer. I used HSBCs BankMail system to send a secure message inquiring about the issue. Betwee n  XX/XX/XXXX  and  XX/XX/XXXX  I  had a number of contacts via  XXXX . There was a lot of waiting in between messages until I suggested that I might be forced to file a complaint with the CFPB.     On  XX/XX/XXXX  I finally got firm language from  HSBC  : "" Upon review, we notice that you have not met the bill pay requirements nor the direct deposit requirements for the promotional bonus.

'' I replied and asked for them to check that again since m y 3 consecutive months of bill pay did occur within 120 days of opening and there was no requirement to begin the 3 consecutive months within  any particular timeframe.     On   XX/XX/XXXX   in reply, they sent me this : "" Please be informed that in order to qualify for the {$350.00} bonus offer a new HSBC Choice Checking, you are required to pay at leas t two b ills per month from your new  HSBC  checking account via HSBC 's online Bill Pay for  three cons ecutive months w ithin 120 calend ar days of account opening or receive at least  one qualifying  direct deposit per month into your new HSBC checking account fo r three conse cutive months within  120 cale ndar days of account opening.     Upon review, we confirm that the bill payments was processed on your account from the month of   XX/XX/XXXX .

Please be informed that there were no bill payments in the month o f  XX/XX/XXXX  and  XX/XX/XXXX . As such, your account is not eligible for the {$350.00} bo nus. '' I replied and noted that there was no requirement to begin the bill payment sequence within any particular timeframe, only to complete  3 consecu tive months of at lea st 2 bill paym ents per month within 120 days.  ( Logically, the terms are designed to allow people to get their account opened and start the process of using their new account - that sometimes takes time - it took them 36 days to get my account opened - it would be nice if they 'd extend the same courtesy of patience to their customers. And they do in the way thei r terms are written - but I suspect the author o the terms and the interpreters of the terms for bonus paying purposes are not on the same page. ) Their final  XXXX  reply came on   XX/XX/XXXX   : "" Additionally, we notice that you r Personal internet ban king service was successfully activated on   XX/XX/XXXX .  However, you initiated your first bill payment only in the month o f  XX/XX/XXXX .  As such, we regret to inform you that you do not qualify to receive the {$350.00} bonus. '' So, more of the same. So I turned to the phones.     I called customer service on th e  XX/XX/XXXX  to  attempt to address the issue. On the phone call, my last contact with the bank, I was told that researching the issue could take until   XX/XX/XXXX .      I realize that things can sometimes take a bit of time, but this is somewhat ridiculous. 23 days to research an issue that would seem fairly simple to address? I suppose for a bank that takes 36 days to get an account opened that should n't seem surprising, but at some point I start looking for an adult to step in and make a determination on things.     Their bonus terms were fairly clear and I satisfied them. A new account opening bonus is due. I do n't know why a bank that wanted to get a new customer and was willing to spend {$350.00} to get one would work so hard to now push that customer away, but that 's where we are in the process. I honestly do n't know what these folks are thinking.     I 'd appreciate a review of the issue and a final response from the bank so I can determine if we will continue to do business or forever be estranged.",NFA,0,0,5,0,0,,0,2,0

Allowing a financial product to be sold at a checkout point where cashiers can demand access to personal information such as a driver 's license, and get access to personal things such as a signature to be used for very powerful things should simply be banned as fraudulent activity such as this happen. Target and TD executives should also have their emails reviewed for any systematic program to provide bonuses on the opening of RED Card accounts. 

Please see all problems with the RED Card accounts. 
XXXX As a resolution, Target has a Guest Services desk at the minimum and all financial products should be required to be verified there there with proper paperwork upfront provided on paper instead of through any checkout flow where it is prone to misuse by its cashiers. Anything not opened there and through the cash register should be closed, and all credit claims stopped.",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,3,0

I think that my documentation was extremely sufficient and in actuality this company is avoiding me, hurting me, and accusing me of not being me. They are using such tactics a lot against consumers an that is not fair. Who else would I be? How dare they deny me after EVERYTHING I supplied on my behalf.

I am a regular working person, not a lawyer, activist or an advocate of any kind. I do OK in my chosen profession financially, which has allowed me to pay my required alimony and child support to my ex-wife, and to help various friends out when they need it. Some do not have cars or bank accounts, so I have been sending them money to pay their bills, buy food and medicine and such via Wal-Mart Store-To-Store money transfer. It is convenient, low-cost and easily accessible for them. Wal-Mart uses a company, Ria Money Transfer, which is a subsidiary of the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I send the first half of my twice-monthly alimony and child support payments to my ex-wife, {$900.00}, which is the maximum you can send in a 24 hour period. I was required to show identification, which I gladly did, and sent her the money. The next day, I was planning to send XXXX of friend 's money, {$40.00} and {$300.00} respectively, so that they could get through the month. Both are unemployed, and only XXXX has any income at all ( SSI ) but it does n't cover her medicine costs for the month. They count on me to help, and I am glad I can. 
So after sending the {$900.00} to my ex-wife, I received a call from the Compliance Department of Ria Financial. The person I spoke with, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ) informed me that my current transfer was blocked, and so were all future money transfers. This is after they had already taken out the {$900.00} from my bank account. I make good money, but {$900.00} is a substantial sum to me. And even more worrying, my ex-wife would be unable to make her mortgage payment. Also, I had people counting on me to send them money the next day. I asked why, and I was told that I had sent more than {$20000.00} in a calendar year, and they demanded that I fill out a form asking all kinds of personal and financial information, the name and address of my employer, send them a copy of my driver 's license and passport, and a copy of my most recent paystub. If I did not supply the demanded information, they would not release the {$900.00} I had already transferred, and ban me from sending any more money through Wal-Mart. 
As I have said, I have people I care about depending on me, and I was, I will admit, frankly enraged. I demanded to know why I was being treated like a criminal. I had done nothing wrong or broken any laws or regulations that I know of. The representative of Ria Financial again demanded that I supply the information or else they would not release the {$900.00} or allow me to do any future transfers. I have people depending on me. This was now a hostage situation, and I had no choice but to comply. I emailed them the completed form a scan of my driver 's license and passport, and my paystub of XXXX/XXXX/2015. 
Being forced to disclose this information and supply documents like a copy of my ID 's and paystub is just wrong. It is also a clear violation of my rights as a consumer under GLBA. It has also caused me a great deal of distress and worry. I ca n't close my bank account right now, and now someone somewhere in the world knows everything there is to know about me, and there is nothing I can do about it. 
No one should have to live with the stress of what I currently live with, knowing that at any time my personal and financial information is subject to compromise.

The RIC was initiated in XXXX New York and is subject to New York State law ; it did not specify any terms relating to convenience fees for payment. Upon making my first payment, I noticed that Santander was forcing me to pay a convenience fee of {$10.00} per payment to pay by credit card as opposed to mailing my payment in to them.

The bank can not allege that the ban on convenience fees does not apply to them because they 're not based in New York. I originated my retail installment contract with a New York auto dealer subject to the laws of New York ; the sale of the contract, which has no clause regarding convenience fees or fees for making payments to an out-of-state lender can not exempt the lender from New York 's requirements concerning convenience fees. 

I made XXXX payments for which I was charged this convenience fee, totaling {$180.00} in damages. I demand that Santander pay back the {$180.00} in full as this is an illegal convenience fee. I also request that the CFPB look into this practice to prevent them from subjecting other consumers to these illegal convenience fees for making payments. 

Additionally, I paid off my loan in full over two weeks ago, but have received no correspondence from Santander indicating that this has taken place, nor have I received any documentation regarding the release of my lien. I request that process be put into motion if it has not already. 

Finally, the loan was overpaid by {$39.00}, and I have received no refund for this amount or correspondence in regards to it.",NFA,0,0,0,0,,5,0,0,0

I started an online business while in college selling high-value designer goods. I was the victim on an online return fraud, caused by EBAY and PAYPAL. in which the individual returned me a counterfeit item via USPS mail. 

I sold an individual named XXXX of XXXX, NJ ( Shipped to his address at XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) a vintage, handmade designer belt for {$500.00}. He opened up disputes with the payment processing company, first falsely claiming that he did not receive the item ( when I checked the USPS tracking it had arrived that morning ). Ebay ended up siding with me after I contacted USPS and provided proof the item was received. 

He then opened up a different dispute claiming that the item was not as described, claiming that it was a counterfeit belt, which forced me to accept a return. When I received his return, he had sent me a counterfeit replica of the belt I had sold him. The item he returned to me was completely different than I originally sent. 

After providing these images, ebay sided with me. He then opened up a dispute on paypal, which they sided with him. I called paypel a dozen times and provided pictures, and they still refunded him the money from my account, claiming I needed a police report as proof. 

I attempted to contact the XXXX police department by phone in XXXX, and was told to contact my local police department. At this time, I was in college in XXXX, XXXX, and unfortunately they told me to contact the XXXX police. They were both useless. Thus, I filed 2 FBI IC3 Internet Criminal Complaint forms ( # XXXX and # XXXX ). Finally, paypal gave me money back out of their own pockets. 

The transaction took place on ebay through paypal. Neither of the companies assisted me in any way. I contacted multiple other sellers from his transaction history and they told me he had performed the same return fraud against them. As far as I know he has done this at least 4-5 times. I have picture evidence to back up everything I have said, as well as screenshots of the entire conversation history. He sent me multiple abusive and threatening messages in the course of commiting the return fraud, all of which I have documented. 

The worst insult is that ebay has deleted all of the negative feedback I left the buyer. They deleted other feedback from different people he scammed. They removed all of the resolution center history off the website, making it inaccesible to me. They wiped clean any evidence of this ever happening. The user changed his username, and did not receive a ban, even though he very clearly deserved it.

I asked to return the watch for a refund, as the merchant obviously was not going to honor the stated 2 year warranty. My request was denied on the grounds that merely opening the watch case voided the warranty - even though this was not forbidden in the merchant warranty policies. 
I disputed the charge on my credit card through Capital One, who sided with the merchant. It turned out that in the merchant 's response, he fraudulently altered the terms and conditions on his website in response to my dispute, and then submitted those in his rebuttal.

So I have to call them monthly to prepay principal. Here 's the issues1 ) They do n't let me prepay principal if it 's between the XXXX & XXXX of the month as they consider my mortgage "" late ''? That is not what the note says. So I 'm forced to wait until they clear my monthly mortgage check ( which has NEVER BEEN LATE ) to make a principal payment. 
2 ) XXXX out of XXXX times they apply this principal payment to an upcoming mortgage payment even after I have directed it to be applied to principal. When questioned, they say it 's their system limitation Well now I notice that they actually apply the principal payment when I finally call them to have it fixed!! Not when they received it. So my amortization schedule is incorrect. 

They are horrible!!! I 'm considering paying off my mortgage to avoid having to deal with them!! They should be banned from mortgage processing due to their gross incompetence!",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called the number on the letter, because I do not have an account with XXXX ; and I am glad that I did, because I discovered that someone has been trying to impersonate me ; or XXXX XXXX is LYING ; Either way ; it is a Huge RED FLAG. 

XXXX in XXXX 's Ombudsman 's Office stated that XXXX XXXX sent the letter as a follow up on a conversation that she said that I had on XX/XX/XXXX. I NEVER HEARD OF XXXX XXXX until I received this letter on today ; XX/XX/XXXX. So what is this person really up to? She is up to FRAUD. I HAVE NEVER AN ACCOUNT WITH XXXX ; and XXXX 's Ombudsman Letter Validates this fact. 

I received a Letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that Validates that I have NEVER HAD AN ACCOUNT WITH XXXX ; and neither has my husband, XXXX. The Letter was from XXXX 's Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX and it stated, "" Our records indicate we have not received authorization from the Customer to provide account information to you. Therefore, we are unable to release any information regarding the account. '' ( Letter Attached ) XXXX needed authorization from the Customer to provide account information to me. But this XXXX XXXX claims that she spoke to me ; I AM NOT THEIR CUSTOMER AS THEY VALIDATED, AND NEITHER IS MY HUSBAND. 

So, why is this person lying? She is lying because of the Criminal Charges of Theft by Conversion-Felony Charges pending. They want to manufacture an Account to cover themselves. 

We OWN OUR HOME ; and there are No Mortgages or Liens ; and we have NEVER had an account with XXXX ; but according to Altisource Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX ; XXXX 's attorney, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, instructed Altisource to break into our home ; making a false claim of foreclosure. It Was a LIE ; just like this XXXX XXXX is LYING. 

XXXX is known for Stealing Homes using Foreclosure as the front. The Consent Order investigation revealed that manufacturing and filing False, Deceptive, Documents and Affidavits ; flies Illegal Foreclosures and Violates Homeowner 's Rights. 

Because they are still doing this ; they are being sued by the CFPB AGAIN along with 25 States ; that 's half of the country. The 25 States have also banned XXXX. Massachusetts kicked them our completely. 

I do n't know the depth of these LIES AND IMPERSONATIONS. Did they try and file false documents with the county, pretending to be XXXX XXXX. They better hope and pray that they did n't. 

Either XXXX XXXX is Lying or Someone is pretending to be XXXX XXXX ; or BOTH. Impersonation is Identity Theft. I dont know how far these crooks will go. 
XXXX and Altisource broke into our home ; and attempted to transfer our utilities to their name. Since these crooks went that far ; they are No Limits to what they would do, including impersonate me at the county records signing my name in a Fraudulent Property Transfer. 

I have already provided the CFPB with the Police Report with Charges of Theft by Conversion-Felony ; but this latest incident may include an additional charge of Identity Theft, a Federal Charge. 

The Suspect listed on the Police Report is Altisource ; but Altisource Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX named XXXX 's Attorney, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, as the person who gave them the instructions to break into our home ; maybe the search for this Impersonator should begin here. I will report it to the Authorities as such.",NFA,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0

The following is a timeline with detailed accounts of every interaction, conversation and event that took place during these transactions. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I buy appliances at Home Depot, aka XXXX, and meet with XXXX XXXX, AKA XXXX the kitchen designer at Home Depot in XXXX, CO (email address: XXXX is her email and Store ID is XXXX) and start template on the exact same day. I explained that i only wanted to get the appliances there so that everybody had proper measurements in the system for template and a seamless measurement for countertops and cabinets; I pay for the appliances separate from the countertops and cabinets that day; I ask to proceed with the cabinets and XXXX informs me that an XXXX XXXX, AKA XXXX, sale would be kicking in on the XX/XX/XXXX; I tell her lets take the next few days to make me the perfect kitchen, and I explain that I would like to spend less than $3,000; I provide XXXX with measurements based on details she told me we needed, including distances from windows to walls and ceilings to floor and a variety of other numbers; we meet for 3 hours that day and she tells me she will email me the rendering later; she does so and I send back reply email (within the hour) correcting one major measurement error (which later cost us an entire wall cabinet and circuit for led countertop lights (see email proof from myself, XXXX, sent on XX/XX/XXXX).

XX/XX/XXXX- I email XXXX asking for new rendering, but she never sends; I call in and she tells me she is having trouble with the spacing for cabinets on the rendering and to sit tight; I go back in later that day and sit with her and XXXX  XXXX, AKA XXXX, gets involved, gives us advice for a dead corner in order to get the dish washer in to the right of the sink and make everything fit; I explain that I am not satisfied with having to waste that space, explaining that I would prefer a ""lazy Susan"" or ""blind corner,"" but after being told neither can fit and coming to appreciate the template, and even asking a number of times are you sure these wall cabinets will all fit? they reassure me that as long as the measurements are correct, they will all fit; I say I will trust their word and that we will finalize everything for when the sale kicks off.

XX/XX/XXXX- kitchen demo begins, I completely gut my old kitchen and begin putting tile backer board down in prep for tiling floors.

XX/XX/XXXX- I go back into HD and see XXXX new rendering, and explain that i am amazed that everything can fit- including the wall cabinets on east side wall. I then explain I dont feel comfortable hiring a cabinet company to make my cabinets without someone from the store coming to measure on site, so I ask if I can hire the HD measurers and she says ""no, not without them doing install;"" she asks how close I live and I explain its 5 minutes away, and how I would trust her and be grateful if she would check her measurements on the rendering she created; she agrees to come over after work and double check the measurements with me; I email her directions to my house and she comes after she gets off at XXXX for final measurements before placing order.

XX/XX/XXXX- XXXX  assures me that she has double checked everything and we are good to go and everything will fit; I explain that I only have XXXX on me and would like to potentially pay for a down payment towards cabinet that day; XXXX tells me the only way to proceed with the order would be to pay in full that day and mentions a HD financing option that has 24 months financing; I explain that I am hesitant to finance something and mess up my credit, but she tells me its the only way to proceed; we sign me up for the credit card and place the order .

XX/XX/XXXX- go into the HD and meet with XXXX to order the countertops; she also orders sink; asks me if I need plumbing and I say only sink install; I tell her that I ONLY need sink install and no plumbing whatsoever; ask if I can just buy counter and she says must hire the installation to secure order; i agree and we add this order to my HD financing, charges me $XXXX on HD cc and assures me that the order is now paid for in full
 XX/XX/XXXX- cabinets are dropped off; XXXX is out of town so wait a week for XXXX to return; upon inspection, 2 doors are noticed to be scuffed up so I speak to XXXX (supervisor at XXXX) about rushing their shipment to arrive before install; she kindly obliges, and this is my first interaction with the cabinet manufacturers.

XX/XX/XXXX- My electrician, XXXX XXXX, comes and installs new circuits for all kitchen appliances plus led countertop lights; walls are all ripped out and new electrical lines are run for counter lights, microwave outlet and all the appliances (see pictures).

XX/XX/XXXX - all new drywall is installed and holes are made in places according to the template and measurements provided by XXXX, 2 of which turned out to be useless (see pictures).

XX/XX/XXXX - after two days of installation, my general contractor - XXXX XXXX, AKA XXXX or XXXX"", who XXXX XXXX (manager at Home Depot store XXXX) later met -  stops when he realizes there is no dishwasher return for counter support or dw"" stability- also a complete open hole visible back to drywall @northeast corner of kitchen (see pictures); second problem emerges: 3 inches off on measurement from north kitchen wall to wall (was told to be 133"" but only entered in as 130"") so 6"" filler piece has no filling capabilities for ""dead corner""; 3rd problem emerges: 9"" wall cabinet to enclose microwave hold has no space because designer ignored email sent XX/XX/XXXX reminding 64"" from wall to window frame but designer ignored the email and never changed the template; XXXX makes me take an extra trip home to get the useless cabinet for return before even being willing to issue any refund; as a cause and effect: entire circuit for led lights and useless holes installed in wall by electrician; contractor is paid $XXXX and electrician paid $XXXX for led light circuit line run down; go back into home depot with cabinet that never should have been ordered in the first place and managers XXXX and XXXX issued a total of $XXXX in refunds and gave me condescending attitude about why I felt entitled to a refund in the first place; XXXX spends 40 minutes finding me some filler pieces and a wall column to close in that microwave, wall column is 42"" height (needed 39"") and 3"" deeper then every other wall cabinet (see pictures,  realized on XX/XX/XXXX installation); refuses to acknowledge her mistakes, but reveals that the corner cabinet will be obstructed by the microwave- a concept never before mentioned despite template having all items purchased at home depot the day of original design start (XX/XX/XXXX); I am told to leave with $XXXX, which is all I would be getting, and that I should be happy I even got anything.

XX/XX/XXXX- electrician comes to house and wires up outlet in upper wall cabinet over the microwave; runs a line directly down to basement sub panel and cuts line to fit in place for outlet; cuts out hole in back of cabinet for outlet and cover and is paid $XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX - upon inspecting order receipt after seeing XXXX on Friday, it was realized that no dw return had been ordered so I went back into HD and sat with XXXX for an hour to toy around with filler ideas before ordering the dishwasher return and some filler pieces; after the piece is ordered, the manager XXXX gives XXXX clearance to pay for one item but I must still pay for my shaker trim molding- full compensation is still not even provided but i am once again told that's the best they can do.

XX/XX/XXXX - I get worried about how this is being handled and reach out to XXXX; I speak to XXXX, a supervisor, who insists she has to talk to the distributor about this issue and try to help me resolve it with HD; she calls back and leaves a voicemail telling me to expect a call from either XXXX or XXXX from the XXXX store; later I get frustrated by how wronged I have been at the XXXX store so I pursue an avenue above the local level; I meet with XXXX , XXXX at XXXX when no one at XXXX store will provide assistance; he makes it a main priority and even emails XXXX XXXX and theIr DM and branch managers above the local level; I thank him and return home; get XXXX ready to do crown molding and install microwave the next day after installation drop off.

XX/XX/XXXX- still no word from XXXX or anyone at HD but XXXX is at house when appliances are dropped off at XXXX XXXX and we see that the microwave hangs 3 inches lower then expected; the measurements for the microwave are 3 inches off despite exact specifications being in HD  system; he is forced to stall on microwave install and we realize he can't do crown molding either because he will now have to remove the upper wall cabinet that doesn't fit; I email XXXX immediately but get no response about that problem, she emails back 9 hours later asking about countertop plumbing and telling me it will cost $XXXX if i want them to do it (mentions in email that I already told her I was all good); I meet with XXXX for 2 hours during that day and place multiple orders for 2 new pieces without help of designers, XXXX never shows her face to help fix the design; XXXX tells me he has spoken to XXXX the real manager who is on vacation until Sunday and has capacity to provide proper assistance and refund; contractor removed upper wall cabinet and tries to move outlet, but realizes there is no slack on the romex wire and says to get electrician over to install longer wire and hold off on pay and bulk it into next part of the job.

XX/XX/XXXX- meet with XXXX the store manager and told him the story, showed him templates, mock up renderings, emails and pictures of before and after shots from this project, and promised to speak to DM following day about getting cleared for full reimbursement at the end of the project; states that ""this is not right and you will be taken care of"" and agrees that everything is a major let down on Home Depot's end; electrician comes to house and installs new romex line for outlet and moves it up 6 inches on wall for XXXX to fit inside new cabinet for $XXXX; XXXX gives $XXXX reimbursement on handles for cabinets as a gesture of kind faith for all the inconveniences, and assures that everything will be made right; assures me he will be there all week to ensure this process goes smoothly.

XX/XX/XXXX- meet with XXXX again, show him more pictures, he says has spoken to DM and again states states that ""this is their mistake and you will be taken care of""; I sit down with XXXX and XXXX to order more pieces to help finish the kitchen; mentioned I have trusted XXXX  even though my trust in XXXX is what led us here; mentioned consumer financial protection bureau at which point he calmly reminds me that we need to get me all the right pieces and then deal with making it right; he then passes me off to XXXX who orders some final cabinet filler pieces; XXXX promises all pieces will arrive by Fri XX/XX/XXXX; XXXX never ordered scribe molding as XXXX had told him to, discovered on XX/XX/XXXX delivery.

XX/XX/XXXX- I call in to HD  and XXXX tells me the pieces will in fact not all be in on XX/XX/XXXX; XXXX calls back and his only excuse about the misinformation for delivery date is ""they tell us one thing Monday and then tell us another thing the next day"" to justify the misleading information about product delivery, which had been promised in full for end of the week and would now in fact be completed by XX/XX/XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX- speak to XXXX, supervisor at XXXX, who explains upper wall cabinet will ship XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX refuses to provide exact arrival date, warns it could be as late as XX/XX/XXXX. I threaten to return everything- including appliances and countertop order, and he tells me he made a note that I said I wouldn't be paying for any of it and reassures me yet again that i would be compensated at the end after all materials arrive and project is complete; XXXX calls me at XXXX XXXX to tell me he won't be in on Thursday -even though he promised earlier in the week to be in all week to ensure this process went smoothly.

XX/XX/XXXX- I get call from XXXX with no updates about arrival for wall cabinet, but more back tracking from XXXX who says he will not know exact arrival time for any items until XX/XX/XXXX and that the wall cabinet ""could arrive as late as the XXXX"".

XX/XX/XXXX- the replacement pieces ordered with XXXX on XXXX finally arrive, as well as some of the pieces ordered with XXXX and XXXX- still do not have all pieces; contractor is irritated that he has to make time to come back next week too -since i couldnt obtain all materials for XX/XX/XXXX (despite endless phone calls between HD and XXXX XXXX); XXXX and XXXX are at my house when I arrive there, and they bring materials to the porch and ask to come into my house, at which point  i show XXXX the status of the project and each problem caused by depot designer's inconsistencies and he says ""its a good thing i saw this"" and once again promises compensation at the end of the project, at which point I say I am uncomfortable I don't have anything about compensation in writing, he dances around the subject of 100% refund even though i insist i want it in paper; I ask about wall cabinet and they say they ""do not know when it will arrive because of the holiday"" and ""could be tuesday, latest Wednesday"".

XX/XX/XXXX- XXXX emails false information about my countertop order at XXXX (see pictures); unbeknownst to me, my order has been on hold for a transaction i never authorized.

XX/XX/XXXX- I call XXXX XXXX XXXX when I have not received my install date and find that my order is on hold when I speak to XXXX XXXX (email XXXX), only to learn that XXXX charged me for an unauthorized service charge for my countertop installation; unbeknownst to me there was a pending balance that prevented my order from going through- when XXXX emailed me about this on XX/XX/XXXX in the midst of her measurement debacle, at which point she even references that I [in a] ""previous conversation stated that you would either be taking on your plumbing or having your installer help out (see email). At which point I responded and told her she was not reliable and to relay me to someone else- XXXX or XXXX- for any more follow up ($XXXX was subsequently added to my XXXX XXXX XXXX, AKA XXXX,"" store balance without my consent or knowledge); in fact no one contacted me or followed up, and instead she just signed me up for the additional service and according to XXXX at XXXX the hold went into effect on XX/XX/XXXX and I only heard about on XX/XX/XXXX as I awaited installation date information; spoke to XXXX at XXXX XXXX and learned this information that Home Depot was guilty of signing me up for extra services I had outstanding payment owed for and sends me a copy of an email sent from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX trying to sabotage my order and place a hold on it (see email from XXXX sent on XX/XX/XXXX); XXXX asks me when my installation date is and I explain there has been no date assigned due to the outstanding balance (I learned from XXXX that the hold went into place on XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX system due to charges never authorized by me); XXXX insists he will call them right away and get me ""set up for installation"" and when i call back and he has no update at which point I tell XXXX that I no longer feel comfortable that his Home Depot isn't out to sabotage my order and that I have email proof between XXXX XXXX XXXX and Home Depot about a hold and balances never once mentioned to me for services I never accepted; XXXX  says he will look into the charges and acts like its all good once again and tells me to just wait on his call; I insist once again that a meeting with the DM is to take place and that I will not be paying for this service either, yet XXXX proceeds with the order and assures me the meeting will take place when the DM returns from vacation.

XX/XX/XXXX- XXXX came to my house with the cabinets, still not entire order however- had to send guy back later with the rest; he came into my house for a second time and saw the current status of project and the dead corner debacle; he also saw all the emails about countertops and agreed the actions were reprehensible; I told him I would not be paying for either the countertops or the cabinets and that I may file credit card fraud charges for the unauthorized charge that resulted in a hold on my counter order which I paid for in full via the same HD credit card - he told me he would speak to DM and set a meeting for once he returned from vacation; XXXX XXXX, the XXXX, witnessed the entire conversation as he was there for installation; he installed wall cabinet microwave and wall column, which was in fact 3 inches too deep for the cabinet depth despite ALL other cabinets already ordered in the system, so he cut everything down with a table saw to make due; another problem emerges as we run out of crown molding, which XXXX also ordered too little crown molding and we ran out, so XXXX ordered more to arrive next Tuesday.

XX/XX/XXXX- call from XXXX at XXXX telling me measurements are off for sink depth due to sink ordered (by XXXX) to fit in counter with backsplash; I get XXXX on the phone to fix it and after 20 minutes on the call XXXX tells us there is a suitable replacement; replaced with a rectangular one instead of oval, which has 4 inches less depth and doesnt match with the XXXX$ sink faucet i bought at home depot; yet another issue caused by designer and fixed by me personally as intermediary between distributor (XXXX) and manufacturer (HD)- XXXX tells me this is ""inexcusable"" and apologizes emphasizing that he and DM will take care of everything.

XX/XX/XXXX- XXXX tells me crown molding is being overnighted to my house and sets meeting date with DM for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX- I get countertops and sink provided by XXXX  is installed with a dent; XXXX, the field supervisor, goes back to XXXX and gets a new sink to install; I go to HD at XXXX XXXX and try to explain my case to the DM, who told me he ""wasnt trying to be there for an hour"" and interrupted my explanation as to the damages owed, at which point he offered XXXX  (which he claimed to be the remaining cabinet balance) and I turned him down; explained story and he had little compassion, told me i could ""out talk him"" and ""tell my story"" as much as I wanted; threatened to ban me from store if i used wrong demeanor or tones with his employees; XXXX sat there quiet and never reaffirmed any of his prior claims about making things right for me or the reprehensible behavior of his employees throughout this project.

Summary of Home Depot Errors:

1. XXXX XXXX ignored email sent on XX/XX/XXXX with proper measurement from wall to window on northeast side of kitchen (64 - see email to XXXX) 
2. kitchen designer came to customers house to double check measurements the night before the order was placed; see email providing directions to customers house; still got other wall length wrong on north side of kitchen, mistakenly had 130 in template instead of 133 - effectively leaving 6 universal filler piece completely worthless and leaving a wide gaping hole visible to the drywall in the northeast corner of the kitchen cabinets with no support for countertops (see pictures)
3. kitchen designer ordered a 9 wall cabinet for a space that had a 6 clearance from the microwave hood to the window trim, ignored email mentioned previously; the original concept showed wall cabinet over counters, and my electrician installed romex cable for led light fixtures to be mounted underneath the wall cabinets; before ordering, I explained my concern about the space and was reassured that everything would fit; when going in to complain, greeted with animosity and barely provided compensation, but also forced to go retrieve worthless cabinet and cart it back myself; designer orders a replacement wall column to go over the useless holes that were drilled for the counter lights and also to close in the microwave hood
4. kitchen designer neglected to order crucial components for dead corner including dishwasher return and proper filler pieces for the space, despite persuading customer to accept wasted space in exchange for fitting in a dishwasher; contractor has to field cut the return to add kick board and install 2x4s for any support to even piece the filler pieces together; effectively created a lip in the kick board because otherwise there would have been no counter support for that corner (see pictures)
5. upon being confronted, designer revealed that appliance would obstruct corner cabinet and prevent it from opening fully - a concept never before mentioned until meeting on XX/XX/XXXX to rectify original wall cabinet and dead corner errors
6. upon appliance drop off, delivery men show that the microwave hangs 3 inches lower then cabinets and too close to the range oven; it later was revealed that the entirely wrong measurements were entered into the template, despite all information being readily available in HD system with exact specifications* (see pictures)
7. the wall cabinet that was already installed had to be removed, despite outlets being installed for the microwave hood (see pictures); separate costs are incurred for electrical rewiring when worker must rewire things to raise 6 higher for new wall cabinet that is ordered on XX/XX/XXXX to replace the one that cant actually fit over the microwave hood (see pictures)
8. the wall column that was ordered on XX/XX/XXXX finally arrived on XX/XX/XXXX and was revealed to be 3 too high for the other wall cabinets and also 3 inches too deep; must be hand cut in both height and depth in order to fit with the other cabinets - designer haphazardly ordered a completely faulty replacement piece as a useless attempt to fix the original problem
9. realize that designer ordered too little crown molding despite assuring there would be at least 20% extra
10. designer ordered the wrong # of handles for cabinets, despite a 2 week order time frame and never made an attempt to order the rest; I had to do it personally online after the handles came in and were several short of the necessary amount
11. designer responded to emails about appliance measurement errors with completely irrelevant question about plumbing services for countertops; ignores response which tells her she is off the project, and effectively puts a hold on the order through XXXX as enacted on XX/XX/XXXXfor an unauthorized service charge, despite having witnessed me pay in full for the countertop order to XXXX XXXX XXXX; order is effectively on hold for a week, and XXXX emails XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX telling her to keep a hold on my order and lying about intent to contact me about an outstanding balance and ordering XXXX at XXXX to put a hold on my order, which she does the following day (see email chain from XXXX > XXXX and XXXX > XXXX, reveals malicious intent to stall an order that I already paid for in full and made all necessary services quite transparent)
12. call from XXXX at XXXX telling me the designer ordered me a sink that would not allow my faucet to sit behind the sink in front of the window, despite representation on the template as such and a clear understanding from the customer that my faucet would be centered in the middle of my sink in front of the windowsill  ( and yes, XXXX ordered my sink and charged me for it); I am forced to call XXXX the manager at XXXX and express that I will not be paying for the countertop after being fraudulently charged for a service that I never required; XXXX sends me email showing XXXX intent to hold my order and prevent its completion for said unauthorized charges; install date is set at which point sink and counters get installed;  sink is dented so XXXX goes to XXXX factory and replaces it, extends the job by an hour but still gets it done

*the very purpose for ordering appliances, counters and cabinets at Home Depot was specifically for seamless integration for any rendering and template made in the HD kitchen design center - none of which took place when the measurements were incorrectly entered into the original template despite.

Additional Damages: 

- 2 XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX (and a 3rd scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX)
- XXXX XXXX and manipulation at the hands of kitchen designers and HD managers who refused to acknowledge their negligence and make right on their mistakes
- financial debt and credit utilization issues and being coerced into opening a credit card under the pretenses of 24 month financing when the actual stipulations are far less advantageous and I am currently accruing interest on my HD charges with that very same card opened in XX/XX/XXXX
- extra $XXXX in electrician fees for wasted wires and outlets and necessary line extensions

So I went to an actual Bank of Texas branch here in XXXX XXXX with my realtor. The branch manager said she could n't help us and that I needed to call the number on the letter. My realtor asked her if she  could just show some sympathy and help us with the situation, it would be greatly appreciated.

So we left and on the way out, were stopped by Security, who in turn informed us that we were banned and no longer welcome on the premises. We were shocked. We did call the number once we left, but it stated that the number was incorrect. When you call XXXX ( which is the number on the bottom of the letter from Bank of Texas, see attached, it gives a message that - the number has been disconnected ) So we have no idea where to go from here? The local branch is refusing to help us and has banned us from ever going there again and the only number we were given from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX on the letter ) is disconnected. 

This is the only thing that stands between me and buying a home. My husband is 100 % XXXX Veteran and our current living conditions are not sustainable for his long term needs, so we are desperate to get into a home. 

We are only asking for Bank of Texas to right a wrong. The 30 day late should never have been reported, and I just feel that Bank of Texas is not really being responsive or actually correcting what they stated in the letter was already been corrected.

In order to avoid Felony Charges of Theft By Conversion, they claim it was a Foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. 

THERE WAS NO FORECLOSURE ; first and foremost ; you can not foreclose on a Fully Reconveyed Deed filed and recorded in the County Records. We have been telling these XXXX this for the longest. This was further Validated by Title Insurance ; which we sent to Altisource ; and we will attach the first of 10 pages ; just in case you need to see it again. 

In addition to the Fully Reconveyed Deed ; and Title Insurance ; XXXX 's Ombudsman ; XXXX XXXX stated that I was NOT XXXX  Customer. 

You broke into a Privately Owned Home with no Mortgages or Liens ; damaged it ; and you are Liable for the damages. Whatever happens with the Criminal Charges has nothing to do with repairing our home. 

It has been almost a month and we still have not received payment. Our home is not livable. The front door and frame is damaged ; our carpet is torn apart and ripped up off the floor in three rooms, and the ripped up damage carpet thrown all over. The pantry door broke when the some of the ripped up carpet was thrown inside. The carpet on the stairs and upstairs is muddied. No one can live there until this mess is fixed ; and Altisource has the nerve to continue to delay to fix my home.
Altisource 's Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX called last week to state that the case had been sent to the Legal Department and XXXX XXXX stated that they will offer {$1500.00} for {$7800.00} worth of damages if we would sign a Release of Liability that was to be sent in an email. We never received the email ; which would not matter, because we would not sign it away. You will pay for the full damages. 

Detective XXXX called to discuss the case ; and said that an Altisource Rep stated that XXXX was the buyer of our SUPPOSED Foreclosed Property. This was a big laugh ; XXXX supposedly SOLD the home in Foreclosure and BOUGHT the Home that they supposedly SOLD in Foreclosure. Do you see how ridiculous this is? 

What really happened was that XXXX 's Attorney ; XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, acting independently of XXXX attempted to file one of their many, Illegal Foreclosures that they are so notorious for.  According to Altisource Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX contacted Altisource to break into our home ; and begin the process of House Stealing as the FBI calls it. 

They broke in ; changed our locks to a coded lock ; literally damaged our home and attempted to transfer our utilities ; but stopped abruptly and dropped everything ; including the process of transferring utilities. 

What they discovered was that THEY COULD NOT FILE A FORECLOSURE ; BECAUSE THE DEED HAS BEEN FULLY RECONVEYED FILED AND RECORDED IN THE COUNTY RECORDS OVER A YEAR AGO. Meaning ; the Mortgage and Liens had been satisfied. Meaning, There are NO Open Mortgages or Liens or Judgments as Validated by Title Insurance with XXXX ; and XXXX, XXXX XXXX used by the FDIC ; XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 

There is No Foreclosure ; and never will be ; Altisource and XXXX attempted to steal our home ; as they are known for doing. They damaged or home in the process ; and Altisource WILL PAY FOR IT. 

Altisource Ombudsman ; XXXX XXXX stated that XXXX gave the instructions ; but Altisource 's name was given as the entity that tried to transfer our utilities ; and Altisource is named as the Suspect on the Police Report. 

As previously stated ; it has been almost a Month and Altisource STILL has not paid for the damages and they are causing severe hardship. 

Local Police are already involved ; do we really need to escalate this to the State and Federal Level? 

I suggest you take a look at the evidence and review the County Records for yourselves. This is not some foreclosed property ; you damaged a Private OWNED Home ; and you Altisource are Liable. 

We do n't care about what XXXX told you. We have NO contractual relationship with XXXX ; and never have as their own Ombudsman stated. 

Altisource has already paid XXXX XXXX for their relationship with XXXX. XXXX has been sued again by the CFPB ; and since AXX/XX/XXXX XXXX states have banned them ; as well as filed suit ; it 's time for Altisource to get a Clue about XXXX.",NFA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0

","I want to do the following on my student loans!   Here are my thoughts on how the bank committed fraud and broken the agreement with me the student.    Need to have the original, wet-ink note I signed for review because : The bank may have changed the note to make it marketable from a securitization standpoint, thereby raising the issue of whether such changes have made the note invalid and unenforceable The assignments of the note I signed may not have occurred, or may have occurred through an illegal, forged or fraudulent way ; Also to see if the loan agreement owe me the student the duty of negotiating a loan modification agreement in good faith. Failure to negotiate in good faith would be a defense, arguably, to the note ; Failure to negotiate in good faith would be an defence.    The ban k may b e charging illegal, usurious interest on the loans in spite of various rulings which permit banks to charge usury ; I have had made various payments to other banks that that have not been reflected.   The ban k may have written  off the loan with the IRS ( evidence by a form  XXXX  ; ) I need a lawyer ask for the required docs and get a case against my loan note holder.   A lawyer could spend a few hours looking into ( and perhaps resolving some  of ) the  various issues I have outline.     Need him/her prepare and file a complaint but at all times you must make sure that any lawsuit is meritorious ( meaning, that you have a basis, which means that I was defrauded into signing the student loans for a course of study which the school knew statistically would not result in sufficient income for you to be able to service the loan ).     Bottom line Took out  XXXX  of loans 20 years ago and now owe  XXXX . Now repayment {$890.00} a month for 40 years.  XXXX  totally to pay off a student loan. That should be an felony . Plus they wi ll doc my Social Security too. This has gone too far!   There is a reason why student loans is more than a  XXXX  dollars business outstanding student loans.   Was denied financial aid in  XXXX  from  XXXX   XXXX  College and was told to resubmit paper work and fill out that I lived on a house boat, open  a PO box , handed a r ental contract and how to fill out student loans to qualify. The college must be getting kickbacks from the lenders and government. This is 100 % fraud. All I need is just have to have a court order to find it!   If any of the above request can not be meet, it would be a breach of contract. Right?   Take a look at this graph and tell me why its a  XXXX  dollar business. Because our corrupt government made it impossible to get out of a student loans and wants a national full of debt slaves.   I thinks the loan holder and college will settle out of court instead of opening a can of worms and with a risk of being a found guilty of fraud. If being presented with these issues and I think they would settle out of court.   A lawsuit, based on fraud, could also be commenced at the same time against the college and guarantor institution, both of which must have known about the fraud based upon the statistics the college had to prepare to publish. Even though th ey may not now  own the notes, their presence in the law suit might be helpful to encourage overall settlement of the lawsuit and to help us establish though discovery that the present owner of the notes is not the holder in due course and is subject to our defense of fraud.   Student loans are very similar to home mortgages. Both involve a purchaser acquiring massive, life time debt secured by real estate and a higher education and are both underwater for millions of Americans, with the value of the property and education worthless than the amount owed to the banks.   I the student should not only be unafraid of being sued on student loans, I want to start a lawsuit myself against the lender and college.   Bring suit, then settle in suit!

So after attending orientation and learning more and more about the university and how students that were already there told us new students to avoid this place and leave before it is too late for a full refund. I ended up transferring to another university in the same location as my original choice. I let XXXX know that I was not going to be attending the school for which i took out the loan for, and also got a conformation email stating that my disbursements had been canceled. Fast forward a few years dealing with XXXX and trying to explain to them that i did not attend the university and I had a lawyer that even sent them a statement saying so. They told over the phone, "" on my file they have an email/letter from the CFO of the university asking for information on where to send the money back to XXXX '', according to XXXX, "" they responded back to the email/letter and then after that communication between XXXX and the university ended.

Through its enforcement and supervisory work, the CFPB will be scrutinizing lenders to make sure that they are following the XXXX requirements when they make short-term, small-dollar loans to servicemembers and their dependents. Specifically, payday lenders must follow the requirements of the law for all closed-end loans of {$2000.00} or less and with terms of 91 days or less. These requirements include : Annual percentage rate capped at 36 percent : Because most payday loans are for several hundred dollars and have finance charges of {$15.00} or {$20.00} for each {$100.00} borrowed, a typical two-week term can equate to an annual percentage rate ( APR ) ranging from XXXX percent to XXXX percent. Payday lenders must cap the APR - which incorporates all fees and costs associated with the loan - at 36 percent when lending to servicemembers. 
No rolling over of loans : When consumers can not pay back the loan at the time it is due, borrowers can often pay only the finance charges and renew the loan. This fee does not reduce the amount owed. If a payday loan is rolled over multiple times, it 's possible to pay several hundred dollars in fees and still owe the original amount borrowed. Payday lenders are banned from rolling over loans for servicemembers, unless the new transaction results in more favorable terms for the servicemember.",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,

I got behind on my mortgage already like 50 months. I requested assistance at a Non-profit agency XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. My Counselor XXXX XXXX XXXX recommended to continue making my mortgage payments however the lender did not received payments my counselor explained that usually after 3 months some of the lenders do not accept payments instead they accepted total amount due with late fees or attorney fees is the loan incurred on a foreclosure process. My counselor then submitted a loan modification application on XX/XX/XXXX thru the Loan Portal then on XX/XX/XXXX received a message via Loan portal about the Denied for the HAMP program. My Housing Counselor submitted an appeal letter since then the Select Portfolio Servicing , Inc. ( SPS ) Started to ask different documentation all the time from different people sometimes the same documentation over. During this process at the end of XX/XX/XXXX they approved me by phone for a trial payment plan and I authorized them to take the money directly for my checking account I then realized that they stopped to take the payments and they I called and they told me that the loan was under review for loan modification and. Then I contact my Counselor he called and talked to SPS representative and as told that I stopped making the trial payment 's. How I was able to stop them if they were taking money from my checking account and I never call to cancel the payments they stopped getting the payments. We started the process again submitting applications and documentation over and over. Then on one of my employers paystub do not show the year today income this issue was a request from SPS on some of their letters ( attached one ) they stated that if ca n't provide the year today income borrower can send bank statements or a letter from my employer stating the ready today incomes. For several months this was the issue I have provided ban k statements, Pay stubs from my 2 employers, letters and statements from my employer showing the year today income. SPS denied the modification again after they kept requesting the same information over and over. On XX/XX/XXXX my Housing Counselor recommended to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I did however I did not qualify for their services because my income exceeds of their income eligibility. My counselor contacted them and stated the same because my income I was not able to qualify for their services. However they were able to give my counselor a print out with the calculations and according with those calculations I qualify for the HAMP tier 2 (  Attached a copy ) I then asked my Counselor to submit the Water Fall calculation to proving that I qualify for a HAMP tier 2. Counselor submitted the documentation and also submitted update bank statements and pay stubs and the same thing happened again SPS started to ask same documentation over again finally my Counselor was told to submit a verification of employment to prove my year to date income. More documentation provided and they denied again stating that I do not have enough income to keep paying my mortgage, before I was denied because the amount own was too much. I decided to write and submit an appeal letter to SPS and CC to Metro Fair Housing and the Georgia Department of Law Consumer protection Unit. They replied I attached their letter as well. I believe that SPS have been taking long time to get an approval first because they upset that I get behind too much time I having letting them know that I 'm aware of my debt with them and I want to pay. I also let them know that I have some money I have been saving for any payments affront that they may require. I also believe that they are taking on me because I submitted a complain to the Customer Protection Unit and to the Metro Fair Housing. As I explained to them my wife XXXX XXXX   last year on XX/XX/XXXX she left with the worry of us losing our home. I hope they can give us the opportunity to keep our home I want to have the opportunity to keep proving a roof for my family ids why I have been working so hard in two jobs. I do have the income to continue paying my mortgage. Please let me know if you have any questions you can contact me at XXXX or my Housing Counselor XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX or XXXX. I requested my housing counselor with his notes better explain my case with SPS. Attached also Housing Counselor notes. Thank you and I will appreciate any assistance you can provide.

We had many good offers and the one he was competing against was XXXX : 3.0 % interest rate and XXXX cash to close. He matched the interest rate and offered us with cash to close of XXXX. Compared to XXXX, he said no reserved money is required. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, he locked the rate for us and on XX/XX/XXXX ( Sunday ), he called us to sign a document so that he start the loan process and hopefully close it in 20 days before the deadline ; we were set for XX/XX/XXXX for closing. Since my wife and I were going out, and he asked for many informations, I asked him "" what is in the document that we need to sign ''. And he said "" nothing specific, just what we went through the other day ''. So we signed and process started. 
Through the process they asked us for reserved money 3 times and each time with much more. They did 2 appraisals for ~1800 $ while he promised XXXX $ ; all these are recorded based on what they told us and I asked once explicitly. 
Also we raised our concern about above issues, they did not do anything about it. 

But, here is the main part that they lied to us and charged us XXXX $ extra based on lie and dishonesty. On XX/XX/XXXX, when my XXXX agent following up with us on our application, I told him we decided to work with QL. He asked for their disclosure and when I found it under our account, I sent to him. He immediately got back to me and warned me on a 1 % discount fee on the disclosure. I was so mad and angry on QL and we wanted to stop the loan with them. I called XXXX and told him how come he has not told us about this and he never talked about it. He promised us to "" give us credit back to neutralize the discount fee ''. Further he calculated how much more cash we need to close after XXXX earnest money and XXXX credit from our agent, and he said "" we need ~211K more ''. After our phone call, he updated the disclosure to XXXX remaining cash to close and called us that it will be around XXXX. We accepted it and luckily saved that disclosure as they removed it from our account approaching to closing time ; this was another dishonesty and illegal action from them. They extended closing time twice ; to XX/XX/XXXX and then XX/XX/XXXX. 
When we were about to prepare for closing, they told us we need to pay ~230k ( considering XXXX earnest money and XXXX agent credit it adds up to XXXX while XXXX was promised ). We complained that this is wrong and asked client care to jump in and find out what is wrong. 
We found out that they are denying to give us the credit that they promised us because they never told us about the discount fee when they fooled us to give up on our other options and work with them. 
It was interesting that going through this process, twice they said sorry we have made a mistake and we are right and cash to close is XXXX but after few hours they called and changed everything again ; there are phone calls and emails w.r.t. this. 
As the lie was clear to us, and they system showed us a tactic of buying time till closing is approaching, and they left us with no option at that point, we started reaching out to their leadership through social media channels. They denied to give us a letter that they can not give us the loan and as our earnest money was in jeopardy, we had to close the loan while charged XXXX more than what we were promised ; and this was all a lie from the beginning. 
However, as we can think of how many people may have fell into their trap like us, we promised ourselves to follow up. It is interesting that on XX/XX/XXXX when we were closing the loan at XXXX, XXXX XXXX, their regional VP, called us at XXXX. Conversation started with "" he hopes/expect that we stop our social media efforts and take down our XXXX ''. First he tried to described their so-called-fantastic system and as he found out that I am serious on following up on their lie and corrupted system, he smoothly acknowledge their lie and mistakes. However, he said he can not do anything about the damage they have put on us ; XXXX $ plus time and stress on me, my family, friends, agents, etc. 
It was interesting that he offered me XXXX $ as the courtesy/sign of apology and that was all. 
We closed the loan and that day afternoon, I received another call from XXXX XXXX, Lead Resolution Advocate, asking us to sign release forms, that we do n't have any claim against QL so that they can process our XXXX $ out of XXXX $ that they stole from us. We do n't know what to call this ; bribe, paying for silence, what? This is just a portion of our money that you stole from us. 
I should also mention that in the call from XXXX he was telling me that I am wealthy and XXXX or XXXX is nothing for me. This is so shameful. 
Any way, just looking into XXXX and XXXX, we saw people had similar horrible experience as us. And as we start reaching out to them and share ours, they blocked/banned us from their pages. 
Here we are. We can relate to many people that may have or even have not noticed what has happened in reality when they worked with QL.

We are asking for justice to be served and ban QL from working based on lie. 

We are more than happy to provide all documents and emails, and also we want all phone calls to be reviewed as we asked to record those and we were told that phone calls are recorded.",NFA,3,5,0,0,1,0,2,0,0

I was instructed to go into a branch and they would be able to help me. When I spoke with a branch manager in person she told me they only hold on to records for 7 years. I fully explained my situation and she again said they only go back 7 years. I called customer service again and was told by one person they could go back further if I ordered them. I was then told by another person that no they could not go back further, they could only look back 7 years, I want to know if there is ANY way possible to obtain bank account records from this account ( my mother was with me in the branch and on the phone, since it is her account ) from before XX/XX/XXXX. If I can show the payment then I can prove I made it and not be held accountable. If I ca n't get the records from the bank I have no evidence to prove my payment and will either have to pay the original amount or have the court judgment go against me and owe hundreds more. I am so upset that I paid my bill and somehow am being punished. I really hope there is something that can be done to help prove my payment.

Realtor told me he had referred me to US Bank because they had a better option for me with no PMI and that may reduce the monthly payment in about {$100.00}. Then I went to meet with XXXX XXXX, CRA Mortgage Loan Originator who was really looking at me in a strange way, I felt discriminated for my age, explained him the situation of the laid off I was going thru and the very possible new job. He asked me to send him an email with documentation for application. 
XXXX XXXX 2015 I sent an email to XXXX XXXX with all documents he had requested. I did send documents to US Bank for my loan application, like W2s, paystubs and statements from my bank account. This information was sent thru email, to XXXX XXXX, at the email address XXXXXXXXXXXX as he directed me to do it, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. He never answered me back. 
Between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX 2015 I needed help from XXXX XXXX, not only to know about the application process but mainly because I needed to buy a car. I did n't have a car and for my new job I needed one. XXXX XXXX offered me to analyze my situation and give me an idea on how much I could spend in the purchase of a car that would n't affect my house purchase. But he never answered me back. This part is the most hurting situation to my finances and frustrating aspect of all this because he never contacted me back with a denial or a possible solution. I had to buy a car in order to get a new job. 
XXXX XXXX 2015 I had to send thru email a written complaint to XXXX XXXX because he did not answer neither my phone calls nor my emails. 
Same XXXX XXXX 2015 Because I did n't get an answer from XXXX XXXX, I decided to send another email complaint directly to XXXX XXXX, XXXX 's boss. 
XXXX XXXX 2015 XXXX XXXX answered me with an email an a phone call saying nothing can be done. 
XXXX XXXX, 2015 After three months I have not received the written resolution about my home loan application I made to US Bank in the time set by current laws. US Bank and its associates discriminated me because of my age. 
US Bank did n't answer my calls or emails about how much I could spend in a car purchasing in order to get my new job and that unacceptable attitude affected my credit score. I have been affected emotionally, financially and socially by US Bank. It is imperative to be requited, recompensed, paid back from the damages ; detriment and prejudice exercised unlawfully by US Bank against myself.",NFA,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0

The original loan was a variable loan that I refinanced in  XXXX  through   XXXX   XXXX  , a savings and loan bank that went bust during the housing crisis.     I reside in California, and CA has a HARP-funded program for homeowners whose mortgage loans are either underwater or in arrears. I have applied to this program, Keep Your Home California ( KYHC ), and  three t imes I was approved by the program and a letter was sent to the  US Bank  asking for their consent fo r KYHC to  help pay for the arrears and/or help modify the existing mortgage through HARP with a low fixed  thirty yea r term that was affordable for my vastly reduced income due to my injuries from the accident.   
For reasons unknown to me, each time the US Bank completely ignored KYHC   's letter asking for acknowledgment/consent for their help, despite my repeated calls and emails to their customer service representatives assigned to my c ase ( call ed Relationship  Manager ).  My numerous calls begging for their response  to KYHC sh ould be in their audio records ( each call was always noted that it was being recorded ) and my emails to the various "" managers '' and other random customer service representatives should be all there as well to attest my desperate efforts in making  US Bank  to respond to and cooperate with  KYHC so m y loan 's arrearage would be paid off and it would be modified with a better interest rate and at the right loan amount.     In  XXXX , my house was worth  XXXX  in the market, while my mortgage was for  XXXX . The principal reduction program from  KYHC w ould have adjusted this market price reality to my mortgage and would have given me a modified loan at the lower amount at the prevailing interest rate at the time, which I believe was something like below  2 percent. But US Bank simply disappeared each time when KYHC sent them the conditional acceptance lett er. The case-specifically assigned "" relationship managers '' stopped responding to my emails or phone calls and inevitably I would miss  the KYHC  deadlines for the bank response to resolve my mortgage problems. The  random US Bank peo ple I was able to connect to during these frantic times always helped me by relaying my messages to the "" relationship  manager ''  and so on, but they were not able to send the response letter to  KYHC  because they were not the ones handling my case.      One ca n understand if this happened once, perhaps it was the  "" manager '' th at messed up and did not do her job. But this happened not once, not twice, but thrice. In the attached emails I show that the emails KYHC sent me after waiting in vain fo r US Bank  to respond to their offers. They even extended the standard response time of to 90 days after I called and begged for more time when I discovered that once again the bank was ignoring the offer so I could call and write more to somehow get them to respond to  KYHC. T hat did not work either.     Finally th e US Bank offered me  a HARP modification package on their own -- forcing me to sign on to a new loan with all the arrears added on, at an interest rate way higher than what would have been, for 40 years.     I believe that there has been a corporate-level policy of denying beneficial governmental programs for mortgagees, although to me as a private citizen it is counter-intuitive. I do not know the corporate mathematics that  goes into this kind of decision-making, but there clearly has been a consistent pattern of behavior from the US Bank "" relationship managers. '' They disappear after receiving the KYHC offers. I have wrote two letters to the bank 's own c ustomer service people about this but all I got was letters acknowledging the delayed time but that they could n't do anything.",,,2,,0,0,1,0,0,0

We found out Thursday morning that the wire which was sent through XXXX Bank was rejected by my bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) because the initiator of the wire had NOT followed my written wire instructions. XXXX XXXX XXXX 's compliance department rejected the wire because the memo on the wire merely stated "" XXXX XXXX ''. Our wire instructions specifically told them to put the following on the memo : File No. : XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX. Had they followed these instructions, the wire would have gone through. Because they did not follow the instructions, the wire was rejected, with questions to XXXX about the wire to see whether they would be able to accept it. No response was ever provided by XXXX. 
My office contacted numerous people at MLA ( including XXXX, the closing coordinator ) to explain to them that they needed to re-wire the money, using the correct information that we had provided. XXXX XXXX said that they would re-wire, but could only rewire using the same information that was on the previous wire.

They demanded that I physically step inside the branch to resolve the issues on my account.     This is the issue with that request  : Santander Ban k does not operate any physical branches outside th e Northeast Region. I  live in  Chicago. I opened the account online in Chicago, I only ever used the card in Chicago, and I continue to live in Chicago a t this time.     On  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  , I called in to request that my account be closed. The bank continues to refuse any service on my account due to the fraud lock. Again, they demand that I show up in branch.      Santander Bank open ly solicits their products and services to all states, that 's how I was able to obtain an account in the first place. I believe it 's outrageous for a company to expect their customers to travel outside their home state in order to address the issues on their account. I do not like that my account is being he  ld hostage on account of my residency in Illinois.
I have no immediate plans to visit any of the states that fall within Santander 's small footprint. Even if I did, I believe this is an issue that should be addressed by the bank at the policy level.       I will never conduct business with them again.",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2

We believe they have engaged in deceptive lending practices as well as dishonest and unfair loan servicing arrangements.     In  XXXX  of   XXXX  , my husband and I closed on a home equity loan through  U.S. B ank. We were made to understand at the time that this was a traditional mortgage/home equity loan with a standard amortization repayment schedule. We did understand that the terms of the loan required us to open  a US Bank checking account and arrange to have our monthly payment withdrawn automatically fro m that account.     Approximately  six months i nto the repayment period, we started noticing that the amount of interest applied towards the loan payment was varying from month-to-month. In any other mortgage we have ever held, with each subsequent payment the amount applied towards interest decreased and the amount applied towards the principal balance increased. We were a little bit stumped as to why this would be occurring.     Subsequently, we approached the local  US Bank branch where we initially secured the loan and asked to speak to a manager . We asked for an amortization schedule so that we could fully understand why the interest payment amounts were not consistent from payment to payment. Tha t manager told us that I would have to contact U.S. Ba nk mortgage loan servicing because she could not provide us with any answers.     I then contacted  US Ban k home mortgage via emai l. [  PLEASE NOTE, A COPY OF ALL CORRESPONDENCE IS ATTACHED TO THIS SUBMISSION. ] Our first contact with loan servicing was to request an amortization schedule. The reply we received was that they could not provide a copy of the requested amortization schedule.     I then wrote back, wondering why they could not provide me with an amortization schedule on a mortgage!  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , with loan servicing, replied that it was because I had a "" daily simple interest loan '' type mortgage. With a "" daily simple interest loan '' type mortgage, interest amounts would vary monthly depending on how much interest had "" accrued '' based on the date the payment was applied. For example, if my loan payment date was the  XXXX  of the month, and if the  XXXX  fell on a Saturday, interest would accrue over the weekend until the  XXXX  when the funds were finally applied to the loan payments. I specifically asked if this was made clear in my loan documents since when I reviewed them was unable to find any reference to obtaining a "" daily simple interest '' loan.  XXXX   XXXX  replied in the affirmative that indeed my loan documents did NOT specify "" simple interest '', but rather simply stated "" accrued interest. '' This was the first of the misleading and deceptive practices engaged  by U.S.  Bank when we secured this loan. It should have been made very clear to us that this was anything other than a standard amortized loan.  XXXX   XXXX  then implied that by reading the note should we know that accrued interest really means simple interest loan, and that because it didnt state monthly interest we should have then been aware of the nature of the terms. My husband and I wholeheartedly disagree for the average consumer who is not fluent in legalese and/or manipulative financial language it was far from apparent, and deliberately meant to deceive.     I then wrote back asking if I could move my payment date so that I could make sure my loan payment was submitted each month prior to the due date so that I could avoid any excess "" accrued interest ''.  XXXX   XXXX  stated that they could schedule my ACH withdrawal ON the due date or  1 to 5 days AFTER the due date ( thus incurring even more "" accrued interest '' ) but that they were  unable to move it to a date prior to the scheduled due date. I find it suspicious that a simple keystroke cant change my ACH withdrawal to the date of my choosing as long as it is within the on time payment window. I then asked if I could cancel my ACH withdrawal and manually schedule payments and she confirmed that by doing so I would violate the terms of my loan.     In summary , U.S. Bank  deceived my husband and me when receiving this loan as to the specific type of mortgage we were obtaining. Indeed, it seems the note was deliberately written to be misleading and/or deceptive to any person/consumer who does not have a background in the legal or financial industries . US Bank is also forcing us to pay extra accrued interest on our loan month after month ( e ven with an on time ACH withdrawal ) due to when they have chosen to withdraw the funds from our account and apply it to the loan. They are also refusing to allow us to escape these excess interest charges by failing to allow a loan payment prior to the due date . US Bank also acknowledges that submitting the loan payment by any other method than through ACH with a US Bank Checking a ccount will violate the terms of our loan. Over the term of this loan, they are effectively adding hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest costs because of their refusal to allow us to submit our loan payments on the date of our choosing. We find this no less than extortion.",NFA,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0

In  XXXX  of  XXXX  I was made aware on my credit report that I had a late payment t o PNC. After calling PNC ban k here is what I discovered :  1.  My fixed rate lock 3 % HELOC underwent a rate increase to 3.5 % even though my FRL was a t Index +  0 % margin with a minimum of 3 % ( based on 3 year treasury note, currently 1.5 % ).    2. PNC ha d the wrong address and I was not getting statements or notifications of a rate change.    3.  My rate change took effect in  XXXX  of  XXXX  After a lengthy conversation with the customer service rep, even thought i disagreed with any rate change, I agreed to pay the increase in rate interest amount due from the last 9 months of the increase ( it was a  XXXX  $ increas e ). I  also increased my interest monthly auto-pay to equal the amount due with the rate increase. I however, refused to pay any late fees as I disagreed with the legality of the rate change as well as was never notified of the change. The representative told me they would submit my dispute to client relations. I never heard from  PNC  afterwards.     In  XXXX  of  XXXX  I noticed further late payments to  PNC reported on my credit. I followed up with PNC explaining to customer servic e what happened in  XXXX  and it turned out not only were the late fees not disputed to client relations as I was told, but the rate had changed yet again, and late fees were getting compounded monthly.

XXXX   XXXX  was very polite and mentioned he would research the entire account and get back to me.     Today,  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  I had another conversation with  XXXX   XXXX .

I asked for documentation showing that the checks I cut were variable rate checks and not FRL checks, but since my checks were cut more then 7 years ago, the bank was unable to provide any documentation. He confirmed that my monthly payments HAD always been made on time, but with the increase of rate I was being charged both late fees and over the limit fees. He confirmed that the total amount in late fees was upwards of {$500.00}, and the bank has credited back {$120.00} of these fees as a courtesy. I proposed a compromise - I would split the late fees accrued with the assurance that the bank would remove any "" late payment '' posts on my personal credit. As stated I have never been late on a payment to PNC in the 10 years I have been a customer.  XXXX   XXXX , although polite, stated that he was unable to offer any additional then the  XXXX  $ already credited, and that I was also unable to escalate the issue any further.

During the whole year I was not receiving my salary, this bank als o received late payments on my part, with the help of my immediate Family, meaning Parents in this case, Just by the same time the Bank decided to say this account was a lost, soon after I recovered my job, and I immediately notified this in person and with evidence to this bank, that I recovered my job last   XX/XX/XXXX  , and started to work next day on  XX/XX/XXXX , and that as soon as my first salary was available, payments will re-start. The bank first, had on my checking account all the late payments charges, that with my initial deposit to that checking account after recovering my job were collected by the same  Banco Santander. Then, the bank sent a notebook so I can continue with the payments, this account never  actually was at a collection agency no matter the problem at my job and late payments, because I recovered my job and re started the payments before all that happened, why then is been reported as a negative account at  XXXX , damaging all my efforts of credit recovery after paying on time since the job was recovered? This account never had a payment arrangement like my credit card with this bank, which does have a certified payment arrangement with the same  Banco Santander , because I was able to re start the payment before that step, why then is reported as a negative account, as not been paid, when payments re-stared on my part before any certified payment arrangement like th e one  with my credit card? Also,   XXXX   shows that there are no collections on my file? Who can understand this?

For 2 years I had autopay set up, but that was somehow turned off due to an error on their website they do n't claim responsibility for. There was no reason I would use autopay fo r 24 paym ents in a row, then disable it.     Once I was made aware of the late payment, I checked my account which was still showing everything was fine and payment should have been extracted.     Lett er sent to Flagstar Bank : To Whom It May Concern  : Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this letter. This afternoon I had my credit report pulled and discovered that a late payment was reported in   XXXX   XXXX   for my account with    Flagstar Loan #   XXXX  I want to first start off by saying that in over 2 years of holding my mortgage with you, I was never late on a single payment. In fact, I was pre-paying the principal down {$150.00} per month and making extra payments on the account.     Here are my payment details :   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , payment is pulled out on  XXXX  of every month   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , payment is pulled out on   XXXX   of every month   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , payment is pulled out on  XXXX  of every month including multiple double payments as my loan kept showing that my schedule payments were not being processed even though autopay was there, it kept showing balances owed and I was in fear of my account payment being late. There was clearly an error with something in the system that was out of my control but I was logging on and trying to supplement it the best that I could. I felt paying extra would secure me from any late payments.     At some point in  XXXX , something happened on my account but no one can tell me why the auto draft was turned off. I had setup auto draft during the entire stint of my loan, but in   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   it was turned off. I am unsure if this was an error on my part or an error on the  Flagstar websit e.     What we concluded was that on   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   my mortgage payment was charged {$1400.00}. On   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , a new figure was added and a charge of {$1400.00} was assessed. I am assuming the error came in that this was supposed to be the new auto-draft payment, but was entered in as a one-time payment. I never knowingly, or would never intentionally, turn off my auto-draft and elect to pay monthly by logging into the account. I believe it was either made in error, or, there was an error on t he Flagstar website . The website is thoroughly outdated and not very simple in electing payment options. It very well could be that this was my mistake, but no one has been able to tell me that I logged on my computer and decided to cancel it. Its highly likely I replaced my auto-pay with a one-time payment, but I was never called or warned about that move. I feel that after 2 years of doing auto-pay, it should have been noted as out of the ordinary that such an event would take place. This is where I feel that any human that is looking at my account must understand there was miscommunication on the website with payment instructions and something odd was going on.     Around that same time, I was in the midst of traveling to Virginia to be with my father,  XXXX   XXXX , who   XXXX   XXXX   on   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   from his second battle of  XXXX   XXXX . In that time period, you can certainly understand that checking the mortgage payment auto-draft was the least of my worries. In the coming months, we prepared his  XXXX , had to sell his home, and take care of his final wishes and expenses.     The other issue I had was that during this whole ordeal, I was also refinancing my home to save on a lower interest rate. In   XXXX   XXXX  ,   XXXX   XXXX  , and   XXXX   XXXX   a total of  XXXX  payoff requests were sent to finalize my loan. There were struggles there which pushed back the loan process and ultimately led to my loan carrying on months longer than it should have. There is no one to blame, but in all of those moves, not  one menti on was made that my account had not been making its monthly mortgage payments. In this mix-up, I feel it was possible there was miscommunication on both ends. I wasnt receiving notices, I was checking my account and seeing that a balance wasnt owed every, so I had thought my account stood in good order. Everything appeared fine. I believe this was even the case  XXXX  came along, because I do not recall any representative calling or any notice to say that I was on the edge of missing my payment. In fact, I had a conversation with  Flagstar  and   XXXX   on   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and I was told my account was in perfect order. I was told at the time that no payment was due and I had a month where payment was submitted late. It breaks my  heart to kn ow that if someone took the time to work with me as a client, maybe this could have been avoided.     It wasnt until after the payment was already late that in   XXXX   I received noticed. I thought right away this must be a mistake and calle d Flagstar to see what the issue was. I was told that at some point, my auto-pay was cut off and  that I was 6 days late on my payment but no one could tell me how or why it was cut off ; the assumption just was that it was my fault. I went right away and while still on the phone, I paid my bill. In talking to the representative still, he understood it was nothing more than a technological error and he told me there would be no penalty to my credit and he was happy to waive the fee that was going to be assessed. He said since it was caught so soon and taken care of right away, he could tell by my fair intentions and that there was money in escrow - on top of the fact that I submitted payment right then and there on the phone - there wouldnt be a hit on  my credit score an d everything would be fine. The representative assured me of that. I didnt document this anywhere because I took his word for it, and now it hurts me to see that in the end that he failed to own up to his end of the bargain.             I do ha ve one other proble m in that it seems there was an error with my payment and escrow amounts being much higher than normal. I received an escrow refund of almost {$3000.00} after my tax bill was paid and this money couldve easily been taken from my escrow to pay the balance owed. This error wasnt because of financial difficulties in meeting my obligations but 100 % based on a lot of things going on in my life and the errors made on my part with the payment structure of the  Flagstar MyLoan syste m.       I realize I made a mistake in failing to be completely thorough but I do feel I was let down by technology of the payment website and the overcomplicated system. My payment history should speak for itself as I worked exclusively with auto-pay and made additional principal with you had been spotless. Mistakes do happen but when the company truly cares for you, that should be taken care of as part of the cost of doing business wit h Flagstar over ano ther firm. In fact, there was an error with my refinanced mortgage. I had incorrectly input the account number for my draft, and when the new mortgage company tried to draft it, they could not. My first mortgage payment was going to be late! Right away I was on the phone with them and they took care of it. They wrote me back saying that they understood it was a mistake, I was brand new to the account, and they could see that the money is in my acc ount (   XXXX   XXXX   and   XXXX   XXXX   ) and  it was nothing more than a mistake. I feel thats the meaning of customer service and I would hope as a leader in mortgages,  Flagstar would b e willing to treat me with that same respect.     I 'm not only embarrassed by thi s black mark on m y record, but it 's now hurting my ability to buy a new home for me and my  Fianc ,  XXXX . In completing loan paperwork today, I was crushed to find out my  credit score was  dropped to under  XXXX  ;  XXXX  to be exact. That is a very harsh penalty for missing a payment by 6 days, especially when it was nothing more than a mistake at most and highly possible it was an error in technology. This was the first time in over 2 years in working with  Flagstar t hat I had any such issue, and I would hope that the relationship we had and you wanting to serve your customers best that you would have it in you r heart to reverse t he credit reporting late payment on my mortgage account.       I would be extremely grateful if you could honor this request to remove the late payment entry from my credit report. It would help me immensely in securing my loan and allowing us to buy a home we have been dreaming about.     I started my relationship with   Flagstar as you were recommended to me by the builder of my condo. Without his referral, this would be a relationship that was never started. No one ever knows what the future may hold and there could be possible business for us together down the line. Completely shutting out a customer and leaving such a mark, especially for something so little, has equally tough implications on Flagstar just with the thought of potential business lost in the future.
If rates were competitive and some of the great features of Flagstar we  re still available, Id even be happy in seeking a loan with you again on my upcoming purchase. The sad, harsh truth is that without this being removed from my  credit score, I will be unable to  close on the house in time and we will miss out on an amazing opportunity we are so happy about.     I truly am begging you to see this as a human being who can understand the situation I was in, the extreme difficulty of losing my father at an age way too young, and the simple technological mishaps that led to the late payment. If I simply didnt have the money or was unable to pay, I would understand and deserve the penalty. I am in a sound financial decision and have spent many years working to have great credit. Its a shame and honestly unfair that a 6 day late payment, which again only happened in some sort of error, could taint my record and take away something so precious to me.       I am closing on a home on   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and I am requesting this be looked into and handled immediately. I will explore all necessary avenues to ensure that is the case. I will work diligently to get this taken care of and will continue to work every day on this to get it rectified as I tr  uly believe in my heart, this is the right thing to do. If I were at fault 100 % or didnt have the funds, I wouldnt be asking for your help.
I am asking out of the kindness of your heart and as a client for over 2 years, please help me out as a courtesy and remove this late payment from my credit score. It doesnt match the total body of work that I have put together over many, many years and with it being so reason on my credit score, its completely demolishing my credit score.
Please contact me immediately if we can discuss this matter together. My numbe  r is  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX .",NFA,0,,0,3,0,0,0,0,5

The amount of the claim grew substantially due to a sewer backup and the lines under my home, in their entirety, had to be replaced. In the beginning my insurance company was the one playing games and would n't release funds. I was then notified payments were to be made payable to both myself and my mortgage servicer. Work had stopped several times due to non-payment, yet out of sheer luck I was able to get a line of credit that allowed me to pay the plumbing company so work could continue.  <P/> US Bank entered the scene in early  XXXX , after the plumbing and concrete companies had already completed their work and had been paid in full by myself. Since that time,  US Bank 's Loss Draft  Department has refused to release the monies my insurance company allocated to me to continue renovation work on my home.  US Bank was the one n ow playing games, not satisfied with the receipts I provided and actually requested I have the plumbing company rewrite them. Of course the plumbing company refused. After several weeks, I was finally able to ge t US  Bank to release a portion of the insurance funds, however the amount was barely enough to payoff the line of credit I was forced to acquire in  XXXX  of  XXXX . As I was getting pressure from my insurance company to get out of the hotel rooms, much work was still needed to be completed on my home. I had to finish at least  one  bathroom before  XXXX  to be able to move back in.  <P/> Since that time, due to  US Bank 's Loss Draft Departments  refusal to release insurance funds, I have had to dip into my personal savings to continue the renovations to my home. I understand  one  of the issue s US B ank is having is that I do not have a Gener al Contractor. I vetted six ( 6 )   General Contractor  's since  XXXX  of  XXXX , and with the amount my insurance company agreed to pay for the damages, no G.C. in my area would agree to take the job. This is something completely out of my control. So after hitting several brick walls, as  one  not to meekly sit in the corner on my hands, I took it upon myself to continue with the renovations on my own.  <P/> Fast-forward to today. It is now  XXXX  of  XX/XX/XXXX and my home is still not completed. I have exhausted my personal savings and  US Bank 's Loss Draft D epartment continues to play games. I am at risk at not being able to pay my mortgage t o US Ba nk due to their own L oss Draft De partment withholding these funds, and have had to borrow from friends and family to keep afloat. I have submitted every document and paperwork they have requested, and complied with two inspections. I have submitted estimates, invoices and receipts showing all of my out-of-pocket expenses over the pas t six ( 6 )  months and where the remaining funds are to be spent.  US  Bank also refuses to branch endorse a final payment I received from my insurance company after much deliberation. Since the mess  US  Bank has caused and the complete distrust I have for them, I refuse to mail this check off so they can just hold these monies  hostage  too, all the while earning interest and keeping me in limbo.  <P/>  US Bank  has caused severe non-use and loss of enjoyment to my home since  XXXX  of  XXXX . I have no kitchen to speak of, master bedroom or bath and have been living without flooring since before even then.  US Ban  k 's Loss Draft Dep artment keeps changing their rules, and at  one  time they stated that repairs needed to be at 70 % before they would release further insurance funds. When it was evaluated at 73 %, they then said it had to be 80 %. Now they are saying it 's 90 %. How do I get to 90 % without insurance funds? I should n't have to front these renovations ; nevertheless I have and as stated before, I am now completely tapped out and can not continue forward with the renovations without the funds from my insurance company.  <P/> To make matters worse, my insurance company dropped me  ( naturally ), a nd am in need of  Home Owner 's Insurance  by  XX/XX/XXXX . I have already inquired with several companies, but seeing as I have an open claim no one will cover me. I 'm not entirely sure how  Home Owner 's Insurance  works, seeing as this is my first home, but I know there are consequences whenever one has a lapse in merely auto insurance.  <P/> I 'm in an impossible and endless loop with  US Ba nk with no end in sight.

I was appalled, shocked and hurt. I have been banking with you guys for the last 6 years because you guys are the closest branch to where I live. I went to the bank later that day and was told they could do nothing for me and my money would be sent out in a check to my home, at this point I do n't know who to reach at this point and everyone has continuously transferred me to the account risk department to be told the same thing but no one as actually cared or concerned themselves to help me resolve an issue and at this point no one is giving me a chance and I 'm just being kicked out of BankOfAmerica and forced to open up an account with a new bank.

Throughout this time, I have made around {$10000.00} in sales through this Paypal account, with dozens and dozens of items successfully shipped and many happy customers. In fact, because my business was doing so well, and my customer satisfaction was so good, Paypal even increased my release limit from {$3000.00} to {$4500.00} at the end of XXXX. This means that the first {$4500.00} in sales I make per month are immediately available to me and forego the standard availability procedures.

The transaction ID : XXXX represented an XXXX sale where the customer purchased a pair of earbuds from me. Like always, I shipped this item out the next day. Since the weight was only a few ounces over the USPS first class package limit of XXXX pound, the post office agent agreed to just let me use that service, which halves my shipping costs. Over a month passed without any response from the buyer, so I assumed everything was alright. However, out of the blue, over a month after USPS showed the item as delivered, he filed a dispute with PayPal saying he never received the item. Again, any reasonable person would file a dispute the moment they saw the tracking show "" delivered '' but they never actually got the item. Realizing I am protected under Paypal 's Seller Protection ( tracking number with confirmed delivery ), I let Paypal do its work. A few days later on XXXX XXXX, 2017, he filed a chargeback with his credit card company saying he never received the item. Within a few hours of that action, my Paypal account became limited. I immediately submitted every requested document to remove the limitation ( invoices, tracking numbers, my social security card, bank statement, utility statement XXXX, but within an hour, I received another e-mail saying that my Paypal account has been permanently limited ( AKA banned ), and that the ~ {$840.00} I have on the account would be held for 180 days, after which I will "" receive instructions on withdrawing the funds ''. I was dumbfounded. How could my account go from being in superb standing ( increase in release limit ) to being permanently limited due to the first and only chargeback to ever occur on the account? I called Paypal on XXXX XXXX, 2017 at XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, but none of the XXXX representatives ( XXXX and XXXX ) nor their supervisor XXXX XXXX XXXX could offer me any specifics. All I got was "" the decision is final and can not be appealed '', "" we can not release details on our decision, but it was made due to security risk ''. My only course of action was to send a physical letter to their "" Legal department '' ( which did n't have a phone number or e-mail apparently ), and wait over 2 weeks for them to "" maybe '' respond. The representatives told me that a response from them was optional. I believe this is a simple misunderstanding, and something in Paypal 's automated system must have triggered a ban on my account upon the initiation of the chargeback. I am submitting this complaint after many attempts to contact Paypal and to resolve this issue, all without avail. I wish for XXXX of the following XXXX outcomes : 1 ) Restore full access to my Paypal account based on my stellar track record of sales and customer satisfaction, or 2 ) Transfer all funds on my Paypal account to my bank account linked to it. Paypal may keep the bank account information on file for their protection until 180 days has elapsed, at which point, I request for it to be permanently deleted from their records. I have attached files documenting the unfairness with which I have been treated throughout this entire process. Thank you for your consideration.",Referral to partner agency,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0

She goes back out the office come back in by now I am so embarrassed that this is happening at my job.  My personal business is being handled on company time which is a violation (so I was played on probation).   I asked her several times to leave.  She just kept getting louder and louder standing there with the phone on the speaker phone telling me you owe security finance you need to pay it.  People  outside the office could hear her and people in the back of the office could hear her.  I called my boss to ask her to help me get her off the property she was not on the property and told me to call the police.  That's when the lady goes and stand in the door and yells you need to call the XXXX office about your loan today.  She puts her foot in the door so I couldn't close the door I had to push the door close and lock it to keep her from coming back in the office.  People in the back of the office came out to see what the noise was.  So running across the parking lot to my apartment and put the notice in my door.  Which is what she should have did in the XXXX place.  Then she speeds out the parking lot.   I called the XXXX security finance office asked for the manager was asked for my name.  I told the them a lady comes to the phone wouldn't tell me her name I tell her what just happened at my job.   She could have cared less that I was harassed and embarrassed at my job.  I told her that they are not to come back to my job or call and that they were banned from the private property.  I told them to contact me through the mail.  She starts defending the lady for coming to my job.  Beings to yell  going to sue you.  I hung up the phone.  I believe the lady that I spoke with on the phone was the sane lady that came to my job.  I called the XXXX office and let them know also what happened.  I spoke to the mgr I told her I would pay when I could u just started this job, which this incident made me look very bad.

A State of Georgia website indicates that to be declared inactive or dormant, a bank must "" lose contact '' with a customer for an extended period. It says nothing about requiring physical presence in a branch or using a bank 's ATM to maintain such "" contact ''.

Excessive -adjectiveMore than is necessary, normal, or desirable ; immoderate. 

In 2012 I was in the market to purchases a vehicle. The XXXX XXXX XXXX was the vehicle of choice. 

I wo n't bore you with the XXXX shameful hours I spent at the dealership. This practice should be banned. Never the less I purchased my vehicle and I was on my way. 

I was a successful XXXX. Highly educated! The go to guy for all things. However I could n't get a handle on credit and what it was doing to the American consumer. So I started a business. 

XXXX XXXX and XXXX Literacy! 

I want to know everything I could about FICO vs.Fake'O! All the acts protecting consumer 's rights! I had nothing but time on my hands. 

I was paying my car note on time. Settling all debts! Restoring my good name and building a business which addressed my credit concerns and issues, as well as others. 

In this economy, credit is more important than ever before. Credit scores are a misrepresentation of a true credit history! Good credit may have qualified you for mortgage years ago may not merit an auto loan today. This is a result of industry misleading consumers ; redirecting consumer 's attention to a number ; not the data or information which is used to make a financial product or service available. 

All my life I have been the guy who could get it done. If I could n't do it, I found a way or there was no way! So this undertaking was just the task for me. 

I became a independent agent for a financial education company, which gave me access to vital resources and tool along with stating my business. Using the internet and a variety of other resources I began to understand the connection between SSN, our economy, the financial system, income inequality and a host of practices which have distorted the hopes and dreams of so many Americans. 

Do n't get me wrong! I had my challenges early on in life. Who has n't! We are Americans, we wrote the book on this issue related to credit and debt. 

As I mentioned early on, all I need was time, to allow a positive history to emerge before looking for a business loan. 

Some XXXX months had passed and I was ready to secure that business loan. Positive payment history, settled debt, XXXX inquires and a credit score in the high XXXX range. I would have to pay a bit more for my loan, which I understood work was still need. The business loan was going to be the additional work needed to propel me over the XXXX mark. 

In XXXX I believe it was. I approached XXXX for a business loan to my surprise I was denied. So I requested a copy of my credit report from all XXXX Consumer Reporting Agencies. What I was once I received my credit report was outrageous! 

XXXX credits inquire all my credit. Mind you, XXXX different credits inquire an each reports. All do on the same day. 

I was beside myself! So I reached out to XXXX XXXX, Volkswagen Credit and to expect they gave me the XXXX. More or less telling me to XXXX! There was nothing they could do about it. Lenders see the inquires as XXXX inquiry. 

If that were the case I would have had only XXXX inquires on my credit report because, I had did my due diligence months before looking for a car. Which I had only XXXX inquiry on my credit report! 

Life had never been the same because of the excessive inquires! I was left with no other option but to take matters into my own hands. The results have been slow, however worth the time. 
I 'm reaching out to you today for your help. The wrongs of XXXX XXXX, Volkswagen Credit and dealerships, are egregious and unlawful. They have nearly ruined my life. However i can weather the storm. The financial lives of the American consumers is what keeps me up at night. 

I 'm still unable to obtain a loan, because of their actions and abuse of the credit system.",NFA,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hence, in order to market more products ( which I do n't want ), Capitalone is saying "" to the heck with you and your privacy and even though it does n't affect your present accounts, we are holding your account information online hostage until you do what our marketing department wants - i. e. to bombard customers with offers I do n't want. 

Please force CapitalOne to stop the unfair and deceptive practice of denying me access to my personal deposit and credit information because I wont give them personal information. SINCE THIS IS A MARKETING DIRECTIVE, THERE IS NO REASON TO HOLD MY ACCOUNT INFORMATION HOSTAGE. They can always look at my credit score in evaluating continuing to provide me credit. 

Although I think this should be totally banned, here is and easy solution is for anyone who hasnt opted out, eliminate this question. They can have a box to check about the salary which says, check this opt out box and you dont need to provide salary. 

I appreciate you looking into this unfair and deceptive business practice.",NFA,0,0,0,0,,0,0,4,0

The Letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called the number on the letter, because I do not have an account with Ocwen ; and I am glad that I did, because I discovered that someone has been trying to impersonate me ; or XXXX XXXX is LYING ; Either way ; it is a Huge RED FLAG. 

XXXX in tOcwen 's Ombudsman 's Office stated that XXXX XXXX sent the letter as a follow up on a conversation that she said that I had on XX/XX/XXXX. I NEVER HEARD OF XXXX XXXX until I received this letter on today ; XX/XX/XXXX. So what is this person really up to? She is up to FRAUD. I HAVE NEVER AN ACCOUNT WITH OCWEN ; and Ocwen 's Ombudsman Letter Validates this fact. 

I received a Letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that Validates that I have NEVER HAD AN ACCOUNT WITH OCWEN ; and neither has my husband, XXXX. The Letter was from Ocwen 's Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX and it stated, "" Our records indicate we have not received authorization from the Customer to provide account information to you. Therefore, we are unable to release any information regarding the account. '' ( Letter Attached ) Ocwen needed authorization from the Customer to provide account information to me. But this XXXX XXXX claims that she spoke to me ; I AM NOT THEIR CUSTOMER AS THEY VALIDATED, AND NEITHER IS MY HUSBAND. 

So, why is this person lying? She is lying because of the Criminal Charges of Theft by Conversion-Felony Charges pending. They want to manufacture an Account to cover themselves. 

We OWN OUR HOME ; and there are No Mortgages or Liens ; and we have NEVER had an account with Ocwen ; but according to XXXX Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX ; Ocwen 's attorney, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, instructed XXXX to break into our home ; making a false claim of foreclosure. It Was a LIE ; just like this XXXX XXXX is LYING. 

Ocwen is known for Stealing Homes using Foreclosure as the front. The Consent Order investigation revealed that manufacturing and filing False, Deceptive, Documents and Affidavits ; flies Illegal Foreclosures and Violates Homeowner 's Rights. 

Because they are still doing this ; they are being sued by the CFPB AGAIN along with 25 States ; that 's half of the country. The 25 States have also banned Ocwen. Massachusetts kicked them our completely. 

I do n't know the depth of these LIES AND IMPERSONATIONS. Did they try and file false documents with the county, pretending to be XXXX XXXX. They better hope and pray that they did n't. 

Either XXXX XXXX is Lying or Someone is pretending to be XXXX XXXX ; or BOTH. Impersonation is Identity Theft. I dont know how far these crooks will go. 
Ocwen and XXXX broke into our home ; and attempted to transfer our utilities to their name. Since these crooks went that far ; they are No Limits to what they would do, including impersonate me at the county records signing my name in a Fraudulent Property Transfer. 

I have already provided the CFPB with the Police Report with Charges of Theft by Conversion-Felony ; but this latest incident may include an additional charge of Identity Theft, a Federal Charge. 

The Suspect listed on the Police Report is XXXX ; but XXXX Ombudsman, XXXX XXXX named Ocwen 's Attorney, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, as the person who gave them the instructions to break into our home ; maybe the search for this Impersonator should begin here.

It was apparently forwarded to Regions National Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. 

At the close of business that day, Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, the balance in my account should have been {$11.00}, However the last charge against the account that day was a charge of {$180.00}, apparently for four non sufficient fund charges at {$36.00} each made over the weekend of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and the charge for the overdraft which resulted from the application of the overdraft charge itself. 

The charges for the four overdrafts over the weekend were not processed until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, On that same day, the account was charged another {$140.00}, apparently for the four.overdrafts which were processed on XX/XX/XXXX. Accordingly, from Friday, XX/XX/XXXX until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, the account was charged a total of nine ( 9 ) overdraft charges at {$36.00} each, when only four overdrafts had occurred over that weekend, not including the overdraft which had occurred as the result of the application of the overdraft charges on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I would like to point out that in no other instance to my knowledge had the ban charged for an overdraft to the account which was the result of the application of the overdraft charge itself. But it is clear that this was the case on XX/XX/XXXX., These charges were made by the bank within a week after the original complaint filed in this case had been forwarded to the bank by your office. It is my belief that these charges were made in retaliation for my having filed this complaint. 

For this reason, I have not discussed this matter with the bank prior to providing you with this addendum. I plan on visiting the branch office of the bank on Monday to discuss this with the manager, but the last time I went to the bank to discuss this matter I was threatened with arrest. Please understand I need this account I just wanted to be treated fairly. It is the only means I have to collect my very modest pension and social security benefits.

I finally confided in my daughter about this and she started helping me. First she pulled my credit reports and found my old XXXX account was only reporting on one due to how old it is, it 's gone from that one now too. She did some research and this is what she found. 

My XXXX account is past Statutes Of Limitations for suing and was at the time of their letter. Their letter does not indicate that, it was supposed to. I thought if I made a payment it would reset the SOL clock, I now know it would not. 

Their letter gives a deadline date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX for payment, this is why I was certain they were going to sue me if I did n't pay by then. It was very misleading. 

Their letter indicates XXXX XXXX is my creditor. They can not be, they are a debt buyer. XXXX XXXX owns XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as XXXX XXXX. They have an unscrupulous reputation and are banned from filing suit in some states. 

Their letter does not include any of the information it should have. No dates as to when the account was originally opened, the last payment, first delinquency, charged off, when XXXX XXXX supposedly purchased the account and from whom. They did n't even include the account number. 
The amount they are trying to collect is {$880.00}. The amount the XXXX account was charged off for was {$270.00}, a {$610.00} difference.

The bank account holding the {$900.00} was with XXXX ( XXXX ) and they restrict customers from transferring more than a few hundred bucks a month to an external bank account. So XXXX suggests that its customers use apps like Venmo and PayPal when they need to transfer above XXXX 's limits. I wanted to close out my XXXX account, so I needed to get that money out of the account. 

So my friend linked my XXXX account to her Venmo account at my request. She then sentthe {$900.00} to my Venmo account and I immediately transferred the money into my primary checking account that was fully linked and confirmed in Venmo. I 've been a Venmo member for couple years and have never had any issues using it. My friend joined just to help me transfer the money and afterwards she closed her account. The next day the money had n't hit my bank account. I wanted a few more days and still nothing. After getting in touch with Venmo they said the funds were being "" investigated. '' My friend and I both contacted Venmo 's support team on quite a few occasions to find out what the hold up was and when we could expect to see that {$900.00} returned to either of our Venmo accounts. 

Venmo was incredibly difficult and evasive with us. Emails went unanswered and their support team would simply leave in the middle of chat sessions we initiated to get updates on the situation. Just before XXXX, Venmo informed me that my only recourse was to reach out to local law enforcement to get the money back. I could n't believe it - Venmo was holding my money, not my friend or anyone else. After that, they basically stonewalled me. 

Their terms and conditions document explicitly states that after 30 days, Venmo releases any and all funds being held as part of an investigation to one of the parties in the original transaction. It 's been 30 days and they have n't done that. 

Last night I got an email from Venmo saying my account was frozen. They asked me to send a picture of my driver 's license and bank and credit card statements in order to release the freeze, which I did. A couple hours later they replied and said I 'd violated their terms and conditions ( but did n't give any details as to what specific terms I violated ). As such, they closed my account and banned me from ever using Venmo again. The last paragraph of that vague message was particularly harsh - it read : "" Please be aware that any future contact or inquiries will not be answered and that this matter will be considered closed upon your receipt of this email '' Venmo has essentially stolen my money. They wo n't even return it to my friend or to my now closed bank account. I 've never had any of the payment apps keep my money like this before - not even PayPal or XXXX. What should I do to get my money back? 

Oh and just to put it out there - there 's nothing more to this story that would justify Venmo 's actions. This money was n't stolen or drug money or anything remotely like that. It was just money I'dd earned working and needed to get out of a bank account that I did n't like using. There was n't anything sketchy going on like money laundering.

I filed complaints against both of these banks for egregiously excessive bank fees and charges related to unfair credit card charge backs on my business account experienced from unscrupulous ex law firm clients and wherein our previous merchant service "" XXXX XXXX '' "" shot first and asked questions later '' and withdrew large amounts of money from our account and then maintained their illegal and unethical policy of "" holding my funds '' for 90 days or more, even if we provided XXXX XXXX proof of credit card authorization and permission and signatures from those clients. 

Those clients may not have liked the work, or liked our final billing invoices, but they certainly authorized such payments. 

After these unlawful charge backs our bank accounts were negative for 90 days, and every single XXXX placed in these accounts were sucked into XXXX theft. 

Meanwhile all automatic ACH Payments and checks already submitted were denied and humongous fees as high as {$170.00} were assessed by these banks for each failed ACH transaction. 

To make matters worse even though I called in to put stop payments on checks and even to remove automatic ACH transactions for insurance, advertising etc, these banks refused to heed or listen to me and continued to assess these huge fees again and again, thus driving these accounts further into the negative. 

After I filed complaints with the XXXX and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies, these XXXX banks responses were to close my accounts in a retaliatory fashion, "" write off '' this manufactured and false "" debt owed, '' and then forever BLACKLIST me and my law firm business ( using my social security or business tax ID number ) from ever opening up a bank account with them in the future.

I called as I was having difficulty with the online process of requesting a credit line increase, thus I called to asked to speak to an underwriter and g et information re : m y request for a credit line increase.  XXXX  told me that I was not allowed to speak to an underwriter based on what she assumes my "" abilities '' are and that speaking to an underwriter is an option that is just not available to me. I told her that this was a clear example of discrimination and you  may  not differentiate services based on one 's assumption of someones abilities over a telephone. She then asked what my  disability  was to which my husband responded that based on ADA and other legal guidelines, you MAY NOT ask someone to disclose their disability, rather if a customer is asking for another channel to assist them in reaching an answer, they must be provided with that option and options available to  one  set of people must not be withheld or discriminated against based on an assumption of a representative on the other line of the phone.  XXXX  disagreed on this and refused to reroute us to an underwriter to discuss my credit line increase. I then repeated that I would like to speak to someone regarding a credit line increase above {$2700.00}, to which  XXXX  said I could not qualify for. I then asked her to send me an adverse action notice outlining my denial for a credit line increase, as I feel there must be an error on their end as my  credit score  is more than excellent and I have almost no debt, and she stated Capital One does not send adverse action notices. This is against the Fair Credit Reporting Act , Regulation B, a s adverse action notices must be sent out when a credit line increase is denied. I would like this Bank, and particularly  XXXX  in the  executive offices to be investigated for not following Regulation B of the FCRA and discriminating against me, withholding servic es based on her assumption of my abilities as well as asking me to disclose a disability, all which is illegal in relation to ADA. When we asked for her employee number and reference number as we wanted to report this to the  XXXX , she stated that the complaint would only come back to the  executive   offices anyway, implying that you would not investigate or take action because I was already escalated to the executive offices. This upset me even more as there was no reason to make this comment and I am concerned that they may brus h their illegal and discriminatory processes to the side because they feel they are invincible against the CFPB because they are in  an executive pos ition. Discrimination and differentiating services is never acceptable and the FCRA regulations were set forth for a reason and this company should be investigated.

Blank Indorsement 3. allonge On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, BankUnited FSB XXXX FL, was closed by the office of Thrift Supervision ( OTS ) and the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) was named Receiver. 
Subsequent to the closure, BankUnited, a newly chartered federal savings bank, acquired the assets and most of the liabilities of bank united fsb. According to The Purchase agreement between the newly BanUnited and the FDIC, BankUnited was given 180 days to repurchase the assets. 

According to BankUnited they acquired our loan from the FDIC in XXXX and because of this information a Judge enter a final judgment on my property and placed for auction. The record reveals that BankUnited did not acquire the asset from the FDIC until XXXX XXXX, on which time was outside the 180 days per the agreement and not in XXXX as they stated in open court. 
According to the Purchase agreement Section XXXX proof of transfer is required from the register of deeds. The record reveals no assignment of mortgage "" recorded '' in the state of Florida. 

The XXXX allonges provided in court, reflects an incorrect property address and therefore makes the final judgment "" voidable '' as a matter of florida law and must be reverse. As per Florida Statutes when a mortgage contains an incorrect legal description a court may correct the mistake before foreclosure. If, however the mistaken legal description is not corrected before final judgment of foreclosure, and the mistake is carried into the advertisement for sale and the foreclosure deed, a court can not reform the mistake in the deed and judgment, rather the foreclosure process must begin anew. XXXX v XXXX XXXX., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
I am attaching copy of the tax property appraisal so you can see that an incorrect property address is reflected on the allege allonge fabricated on XXXX XXXX and not in XXXX as the BankUnited claims.

I called back XX/XX/XXXX hoping someone with more authority would be in the office on Monday, that way my issue could be escalated. My concern was escalated to the "" highest possible level ''. I was informed that my account was indeed "" banned '' without any explanation and that I could file a complaint on "" their '' web site if I had one. I told them I thought I was entitled to an explanation. They said they did not have to provide one for security reasons. I told them with the current attitude that filing a complaint on their website would be futile and that maybe someone with more authority, like the federal government should look into it. I also said I felt threatened and discriminated against for no reason. 

I thought maybe it was a fraud issue, so I contacted XXXX and asked them to check my identity theft account and to upgrade my account to their top level of security. They said they could find no reported issues with MoneyGram and me. I related my story to the representative. I asked them how I should handle the issue. He stated that he had never heard of such and issue with MoneyGram. He recommended that I contact the FTC. 

I would appreciate any assistance in resolving this issue. I feel I have the right to know why this happened.

Fraud : Deliberate Policy designed to prevent access to pay bills Contract Fraud : Deliberate policy designed to get customers to miss out on offers included in a contract.
Issues relate to companywide policy, albeit one that would only affect a small ( likely 1-10 % ) p  ercentage of customers and likely why they have n't had an issue with regulators yet. **Request for formal investigation by CFPB and not just a forwarding of complaint for company response. ** In recent call ( dated :   XXXX   2017 )  with   Barclays credit card services, it was made clear to me that Barclays has made a couple of policies that violate federal law.
Pertinent Facts 1 ) Barclays like almost all banks use a third party servi  ce to verify identification for the purposes of identifying possible fraudulent activity. There is no issue with doing that, but all of those services (   XXXX   XXXX  ,   XXXX       XXXX   XXXX  ,   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , etc. ) store information on  American Citizens  for financial transactions and therefore qualify under the   Federal Credit Reporting Act.
2 ) One of the areas where Barclays will deploy questions from this service is when anyone uses their credit card balance transfer system. The credit reporting agency Barclays contracts for verification clearly had some incorrect information on me. That triggered a fraud block.
Fraud and Breach of Contract Agreements 1 ) Upon calling into Barclays the ban  k required that I provide front and back copies of drivers license and social security card via regular mail to  Barclays   XXXX   XXXX   to release the account. Several attempts to get Barclays to agree to verbal verification by answering as many questions as needed were blocked by represen tatives. Attempts to get requested information to   Barclays via other quicker or more secure methods such as fax, secure email, upload to secure system, etc. were turned away.
2 ) This act is a breach of contract of all Barclays c  ard agreements as this removes access to their accounts for an unreasonable amount of time. This can trigger forced late payments by preventing access to pay accounts when needed. This can also prevent access to account for needed funds.   Barclays should be able to conform to what is essentially the industry standard of same day verification in one form or another.
3 ) The only rational purpose for demanding an insecure slow mailing of document verification by Barclays is the   deliberate attempt to cause cardholders to go past payment due dates while their accounts are restricted or go past promo periods on special offers that the customer took out the account to obtain. I  f Barclays motivation for the documents was to prevent fraud and not to deliberately restrict accounts that Barclays would provide a more secure and quicker method of submitting requested documentation.
Violation of FCRA 1 ) During discussions with Barclays representatives and department supervisor, all individuals stated that it was against Barclays policy to provide the name of the third party credit reporting agency that supplies Barclays  with its verification information.      2 ) Their companywide policy to deny cardholders and myself the name of the service prevents everyone from being able to request a copy of their credit report from that agency and correct errors on it su ch as : ""  Heigh on your Driver 's License '', "" Previous Address 's '', "" Date of Birth of F amily Member '', etc. Their failure to disclose their provider prevents consumers from exercising their right to challenge information in their credit reports which is a direct violation of the   Federal Credit Reporting Act.      3 ) Failure to provide the name of the service providing the information also violates the FCRA with respect to the right to copy of a credit report after a denial of credit or any adverse action. Prevention from completing a credit transaction on the website is a denial of credit. Prevention  from completing a balance transfer is a denial of credit. Prevent of accessing the website of a credit card and blocking the credit card in its entirely is a denial of credit. The reason for the denial is a vendor that is considered a  Credit Reporting Agency under the FCRA therefore, they have to provide a copy or at least the name of the supplying  organization so that consumers can correct incorrect information.     I recorded the call. I can provide a copy to the CFPB on request if it helps in their investigation.",NFA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This attacker had created   XXXX   unknown, unauthorized contacts and added them to my simple account. Simple instructed me to remove the   XXXX    fra udulent contacts and I did as soon as I logged into my account so I do not have record of the names used or their info used.     These contacts allowed the person or pers on ( s ) re sponsible to ma ke   XXXX   unauthor izesd transfers somehow between themselves and possibly another simple account, in the following amounts, and these BOTH occured on the same day, Tuesday,  XXXX   XXXX    XXXX  .

The attacker labeled the fraudulent transactions as ""  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    XXXX   '', which they have gotten from my previous account history. My account history will show that payments made to this sender were always in the amount of {$700.00} for rent submitted by or on the  XXXX , never near the first of the month when these  XXXX  transactions occurred. By doing this, the attacker tried to disguise the transactions as transactions I would normally make, but the amounts are actually NOT amounts I would ever submit, nor were they amounts I have ever submitted in the past during my banking relationship with  Simple B ank.     When I call Simple Customer support, they have assured me that they are "" investigating '' it and that this is a "" rare occurrence '' and has never happened before. They have closed and locked my account which is pointless at this point since there is a remaining balance of {$8.00} -- - I had to call yesterday to withdraw {$20.00} ( of my remaining funds ) out of an ATM just so I could use that money as a opening deposit at another large firm bank, because simple has now left me without an account to use to pay bills, buy groceries or do anything else.     Simple 's primary mode of customer service is support messages through their website and app. When calling their customer service, I am told I need to wait for their "" investigation '' to complete, not given a time frame -- basically leaving me without any funds whatsoever -- and that they "" take fraud very seriously '' and are working on my case "" as fast as possible ''. However, they are not working fast enough to provide a resolution to me and leaving me with no funds whatsoever and NO bank account in the meantime is unacceptable.     They obviously do not have the safeguards in place to prevent this from happening -- these were NOT fraudulent debit card purchases -- these fraudulent transfers were made by manipulating simple 's "" instant contact '' feature. Both fraudulent transfers were "" instant '' transfers, as shown in the screenshots.     I was NEVER alerted that these transactions were taking place -- - and simple allowed them to occur with no problems!     It was only AFTER I CALLED SIMPLE that simple froze my account and blocked my debit card. If I had not checked my account the day it happened and reporte d those   XXXX     transactions as fraud, simple would have never even cared to investigate them.       I have spoken to multiple customer service people by phone and email, including a supervisor, and the best they can tell me is that once their "" investigation '' is complete, they will issue me a check for the stolen funds. However they can not provide me with a time frame to when i 'd get my money back, HOW someone was able to get not only my account login name, but my account passphrase AND my account pin used to access the mobile app. They also can not tell me how someone was able to add their own email and   phone to my account and create  XXXX  accounts to make to fraudulent transfers on the same day, in   XXXX   different amounts, on  XXXX  different times on the same exact day.
I am left without {$1300.00} of my money and "" Simple '' ca n't provide me with a temporary credit while they investigate, nor can they answer any of my questions as to   how they allowed this to happen. Instead, they defer blame to me, their simple customer by saying this is "" unique to me '' and "" a rare occurrence ''. The public and anyone who uses simple bank or any of their partner banks needs to be aware that this can happen to them.

I was approved a received the card on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  . I 'm interested in this card because of its reward structure for using it via mobile wallet payments ( Android Pay in my cas e ). When signing up for the Altitude Reserve card a nd reading through its terms & conditions, there was absolutely no mention of any rules that prohibit the purchase of gift cards. I started using the card on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  . There was a promotion at the local grocery store for various store gift cards that I was interested in taking advantage of. This was because of  XXXX    XXXX   XXXX    as well as the upcoming graduation season. I planned on buying those store gift cards as gifts/presents for the my mom, brother, friends, and my wife 's friends. Because of the restriction on the store 's promotion, the discount is only applied to  one gift card per transaction. So I had to make repeated transactions for multiple gift cards to receive the discount on all gift cards. Understandably, there was a block placed on the Altitude Reserve card after a few successful transactions. I proactively called US Bank and notified them that those charges are legitimate charges made by me and requested them to unblock the card so I can continue using it. During this verification process, I was not questioned or notified of any rules that prohibits making purchase of gift cards using the Altitude Reserve card. I went back to the store to make more purchases the  next day  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   ) and all the transactions completed successfully. My wife and I thought it was a good promotion and thought we should buy some more cards for our own use so I went back to the store again the day after that  (   XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   ) to make some more purchases. But this time I could n't complete any purchases because all transactions were being declined. I went home and called  US Ban k thinking it was just another fraud block. After looking up my account info, the first representative told me to call  XXXX  at  XXXX  for more information. When I called  XXXX  said that because my purchases are repeating transactions mean they are gift cards, tha t US  Bank does n't allow the purchase of gift cards using their credit card, and my account is closed. I asked her to explain to me why is that not allowed, she mentioned that because gift cards can be converted to cash, it is not allowed. I pressed her for more details and point out to be where in the card agreement that it explicitly prohibits that. She just kept repeating that it is not allowed, my account is closed and it is final, can not be appealed. I asked to speak to he r manager and was forwarded to the manager ' s voice mail. I left a message with my contact info on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  . I just received the call back from the manager,  XXXX . And he pretty much said the same thing as  XXXX  without an explanation or could point out to where in the terms & conditions of the card that prohibit the buying of gift cards. He said I was abusing the rewards because all my transactions are for gift cards. Not only my Altitude Reserve card was closed but all the other related accounts were closed as well (  US Bank Cash Rewards Visa, US Bank checking account, and Fidelity Rewards Visa that is managed by US Bank  /Elan Services ).  This is uncalled for and an unfair practice when I have n't violated any stated card agreement whatsoever. This results in negative marks in my credit reports.

I have gone through numerous layers of bureaucracy and in-house complaint procedures to get this issue addressed without making any progress. 

This loan was originally XXXX of those infamous neg-am loans that reset in the middle of the big credit crisis back in late XXXX early XXXX. We had taken the neg-am option planning to use the time period of the introductory rate to remodel the house. The plan was to refinance into long term financing once the remodel was complete. However, by the time we were ready to refinance it was impossible to get any credit at all. 

We attempted to get a loan modification from Chase but, unbeknownst to us, were put into a situation which later came to be known as "" dual tracking. '' The state of California passed a law banning this in, as I recall, early 2010. Chase and several of the other big XXXX banks paid huge fines. Unfortunately, none of the benefits of the new legislation nor any of the money from the big fines paid did anything to help my situation. 

The "" dual tracking '' worked like this : On the side visible to us, we had a "" single point of contact '' who took our loan mod application, discussed with us our options and told us what we had to do to get the loan modification. Basically, this person crunched the numbers with us, told us we were approved and that we needed to wait until the underwriters were finished with drafting the new agreement before making any payments. We were told that we could not make any payments during that interim or it would cause the loan mod to re-set and that the underwriters would have to start all over again. 

Despite numerous calls to my "" single point of contact '' this story did not change. In fact, the longer it went on, the more that person stressed that making a payment would derail the process. 

Then, we were contact by the foreclosure department and told that we had 60 days to pay all of the outstanding payments plus an ungodly amount of late fees and penalties, or they would foreclose on the house. 

Between the "" single point of contact '' in the loan mod department telling us that we would be getting our new paperwork "" any day now '' and the foreclosure department giving us a hard deadline leading up to foreclosure, we decided to sell the house. Although we sold for much less than the property had appraised for, we did not have to ask for a short sale. 

Now, six years later, we are looking to refinance some loans which originated prior to the financial crisis. Being able to refinance these loans would result in savings of thousands of dollars a month. The negative reporting on the Chase mortgage loan is XXXX of the major obstacles preventing me from completing the proposed refinances. Plus, this reporting is updated every time I request an investigation from the credit bureaus causing this account to appear as if it were new. I 'm told that this single derogatory account is lowering my score by @ XXXX points alone. 

What I am asking Chase to do is report on the mortgage history as if reflecting the loan modification side and not the foreclosure side. You see, I was following the directions given to me by that "" single point of contact '' which were that I must not make a payment. I agreed with those instructions and followed those instructions. 

My non-payment during that underwriting period not only reflected the agreement between myself and the loan modification department, I was told that there would be a penalty for making a payment, i.e. total reset of the agreed upon loan modification. 

Please update the credit reporting to show that the account was "" paid as agreed. ''",NFA,0,0,1,0,0,0,,,

Summary :   XXXX   XXXX  , I noticed a transaction made with the card at  XXXX  while I was at home asleep in my bed. It was a pinned transaction made at a local ATM that I frequently have used . 6 ho urs after the transaction was made, I had discovered it, reported it, and at the directive of BOA I had called the local police and reported the transaction.

Further,  XXXX  informed me that this was status quo policy regarding disputes in their department at BOA, and "" she dealt with this every day and knew regulation  "" e ''  thoroughly. She also refused to connect me with any lateral or higher supervisor and would not provide contact information for a regulation compliance or legal department. She did offer to have her  manager call me within 24hours, a call I am still waiting for.      XXXX   XXXX  , I also initiated contact with this bureau to seek resolution with or without the help of the BOA disputes department.       XXXX   XXXX  , I tried calling disputes and claims department and asking for a supervisor again. She ""  XXXX  '' who conveniently seems to be the only supervisor voice at the disputes call center, promised m e a manager c all again which never came on the  XXXX  or  XXXX .

On   XXXX   XXXX  , I finally made contact with the regulation compliance person from BOA   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX , who informed me that she would act as a  liaison be tween the bank and I throughout the complaint process and that she would have the situation resolved by her own decided resolution date of   XXXX   XXXX  . I informed   XXXX   that this further violated regulation ""  E  '' which requires reimbursement be complete within  seven days, with a maximum customer liability of {$50.00} if timely reported. I also informe d her that the BOA card agreement presented to me when I was given the card stated that timely reporting was supported by a ""  Zero Li ability '' policy thus negating the federal allowance of {$50.00} of customer responsibility.   XXXX   did not seem to be concerned with my reimbursement ( although she did apologize ) nor the timeline.       XXXX   XXXX  , I receive to conflicting pieces of mail.

I also receive a letter from  BOA d ated   XXXX   XXXX  , which states the additional review I requested has been completed and there was no decision error found. These are highly conflicting statements ...     While my first complaint focused on the handling of my claim and the lack of reimbursement ( STILL!!!! ) in violation of CFR  "" E '', I w ould like to now file a complaint that is separate yet related to the original about the timeliness of responses indicative of a willful and wanton disregard for my consumer rights protected by federal regulation with instructive ( clearly worded  ) n otes on how to treat regulation ""  E  ''. I now wish to enforce my rights violated by  BOA  ( hereafter "" the bank '' ) enumerated by the DTPA clauses regarding Banks obligations and duties as a fiduciary.     Regulation ""  E '' i s very clear as to the requirements of its application :  1. An unauthorized transaction was made and the only stipulation that designates transactions as unauthorized is a "" reporting by the cardholder within 48 hours. '' Here I reported the charge as unauthorized and in only six hours. The bank  does not disputed this fact.    2. The regulation application notes specifically state that whether a transaction is "" pinned '' is irrelevant unless the person conducting the transaction had at one time been an authorized user and now was not. The suspect in this case was never authorized to use my card and never authorized to even possess the card, Bank of America has provided no evidence ( and can not unless they manufacture it )  that I have ever authorized anyone to use the card.    3. The maximum liability of a customer by Federal Regulation "" E '' is {$50.00}. When timely reported. Banks may create more lenient but not stricter liability on the part of the consumer. BOA did choose to be more lenient than the fed, because in my card agreement presented when I got the card, I was informed that BOA imposes "" ZERO LIABILITY '' for unauthor ized use so long as reported timely. Because the time of reporting is not in dispute,   BOA admits that I was in compliance with this policy and therefore also the more strict federal policy.
4. Regulation "" E '' requires that in any case, when timely reported, any funds removed from the customer account must be reimbursed no longer than 7   business days after the unauthorized transaction is reported.   XXXX   XXXX   from  BOA,  when I spoke to here on   XXXX   XXXX  , did not dispute the  seven d ay requirement of regulation  "" e ''. In fact she had no answer as to why this was not already reimbursed, but told me not to worry because they had determined they would provide resolution of this complaint by a promised deadline with the Bureau of   XXXX   XXXX  . Imagine my surprise when I received notice that the BOA had asked fo r additional time to prepare an answer when  XXXX  had appeased me by telling me I would have resolution by   XXXX   XXXX  .  Imagine my  further surprise to learn that BOA had already decided the second opening of this dispute against me on   XXXX   XXXX   when I received a letter to that effect today in the mail.     NEW OFFENSE : THE NEWEST VIOLATION OF BAN  K OF AMERICA IS NOT A VIOLATION OF REGULATION E, BUT RATHER A NEW PRIMA FACIE VIOLATION OF THE FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES ENUMERATED UNER THE DTPA.
THE VIOLATION OF THE SEVEN BUSINESS DAY REIMBURSEMENT REQUIREMENT ( STILL TOLLING ) AND IT HAS AMOST BEEN A MONTH NO  W ) WHILE BAD ENOUGH, IS NOT NEARLY AS BAD AS THE WILLFUL & WANTON ACTIONS UNDER THE DTPA, BUT I NOW SEE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THERE CONTINUES ACTIONS WILLFUL AND WANTON, BUT POSSIBLE WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT, ADDING A PUNITIVE ELEMENT TO THE DAMAGES IMOSED UPON THE OFFENDER ( HERE BOA ).     The facts here are not disputed. I made the report to the correct department on the correct date within the time pe riod allotted by "" E ''. F urther, I was patient in allowing a grace period before I called back  XXXX  and  XXXX . What is bothering me now is that even after speaking with   XXXX   XXXX   and being further patient :  1.   I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN REIMBURSE  D 2. HER PROMISE TO ME THAT RESOLUTION WOULD OCCUR BY THE NINTH IS OBVIOUSLY BELOGNA AND THERE IS STILL NO REIMBURSEMENT OR CORRECTIVE ACTION IN PLACE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
3. BOA HAS ASKED THE BUREAU FOR MORE TIME, BUT CLEARLY BY BOA 's OWN ADMISSION THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE ANOTHER REVIEW   AND RULED NOT TO PAY IT AS DENOTED IN THE LETTER I RECEIVED. THUS BECAUSE THE FACTS ARE UNDISPUTED AS APPLIED TO THE TIMELINE, BOA 'S DECISION TO REMAIN AWARE OF MISSED OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER SOME BELIEF THAT THE CONTINUED DELAY IS ACCEPTABLE.     I FIND IT MORE DISTURBING THAT BOA 'S CONTINUED DENIAL WHEN BOA HAS UNDISPUTED  PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE THE CLAIM IS LEGITIMATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH REG E.

BECAUSE OF THE WILLFUL AND WANTON DISREGARD OF THE FACTS OF THIS TRANSACTION, AND THE CHOICE OF BOA TO CONTINUE TO DENY THE CLAIM, THEY ARE CLEARLY NOW IN VIOLATION OF THE DTPA WHICH IN THE LEAST PROVIDES THAT A {$400.00} REIMBURSEMENT IS NO LONGER ACCEPTIBLE, BUT RATHER  TREBLE  DAMAGES OR IN THIS CASE {$1200.00} BECAUSE THE BANK HAD NOTICE AND CHOSE WILLFULLY AND WANTONLY TO IGNORE THE FACTS AND FAIL TO REIMBURSE THE ACCOUNT.

I am seeking that my case be considered by the department of education under exceptional circumstances. The Loan discharge form limits of 120 days provide only the most narrow of windows to correct this situation and exclude a great number of former students including myself from corrective actions. 

List of exceptional circumstances : 1. Misrepresentation of accreditation. 
2. The schools discontinuation of academic programs. 
3. Current litigation 's by the state that are affecting operational viability of the school. 
4. Finding by federal agency & recent litigation resulted in prohibition of federal funds for school. 

I feel that the school manipulated the circumstances of my enrollment and conducted themselves in a manner that is not consistent with the integrity expected of institutions that provide higher education. As I have acted in an upstanding manner and met my obligations to date, I would like to consider having the remaining federal loans that I am obligated to repay discharged or forgiven. I think that if the government is taking actions against this school for deceptive practices it should also be open to mitigating the financial burdens of those that were subject to those practices and have met every obligation thus far. 

I have several complaints specifically regarding my enrollment at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

~ I was told while discussing enrollment with the recruiter that XXXX XXXX was an accredited institution and that I would be able to pursue my masters at XXXX after graduation. - This proved to be false. XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX and XXXX determined that XXXX "" is not in compliance and is unlikely to become in compliance with [ XXXX ] accreditation criteria. 

~ I was later told that the accreditation process was ongoing and that XXXX XXXX would be fully licensed by the state and accredited in the near future.- This also proved to be false. 

~ The credits I earned and took out Federal and Private loans for are unable to be transferred to federally compliant institutions like XXXX or XXXX. 

~ Until student loans are fully repaid, I am not able to pursue federal funds for education at a compliant institution like XXXX or XXXX. 

~ The location where I attended has been closed and is no longer in operation. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL. XXXX ~ XXXX XXXX XXXX is currently involved in several litigation 's, some of which are banning new students from enrolling and ultimately will result in the school being closed.

I took a 0 % interest 60 month loan with VW Credit. I made every month payment timely and was never late. On XX/XX/XXXX, VW announced that they had used "" cheat devices '' in their TDI ( i.e Diesel ) vehicles. The intent of these devices was to violate American environmental standards. In particular, to cheat in meeting NOx emission output. VW immediately imposed a ban on its dealers from selling these effected new and/or used TDI vehicles. As a result, TDI vehicles have certainly lost significant value since VW has n't determined how, or if, the vehicles can be repaired to legally satisfy EPA emission standards. The matter is well know and rather than explain it further, I will instead address my complaint. I made a request to VW Credit to suspend additional loan payments until such time that the EPA accepts the remedy regarding the TDI scandal. I purchased the vehicle based on VW 's claim that the vehicle is a "" Clean Diesel '' that provided efficient use of diesel fuel in delivering the rated MPG along with EPA complaint emissions standards. The sale was based on a lie and fraud on the part of VW. VW themselves do not deny the wrongdoing. I do not want to continue paying for this vehicle until I know that the vehicle satisfies all the conditions and expectations made to me when I purchased the car.

Hi XXXX,

I am in receipt of the letter from SPS of notice of default.  I was waiting for the email you were going to send regarding our recorded conversation on XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX  MST.  I also am waiting for you to call me back after you sent your manager notice regarding my rights to request a forbearance for six months for the amount owed of $XXXX, as we discussed in our conversation.

Perhaps SPS should have instructed me to fill out forbearance forms instead of re-modification forms since I already have a remodification with HAMP, when I told SPS back in XXXX XXXX, and every month since about my financial hardship that was impending. To that statement, there are no specific forbearance forms or payment plan forms on the SPS website to fill out.

As I'm sure you recall since the call was recorded, I told you that I would like to speak with the owner of the note and you told me that the owner was XXXX.  You didn't mention XXXX XXXX. Now, are there different loan numbers for XXXX and XXXX  XXXX as I do not see those numbers in the letter from SPS that I received today.  HUD, the Colorado AG, and OIG want these numbers for verification of the loan.

Of note, the only dispute I have with SPS is the fact that they had me fill out the wrong forms (RMA) and there appears not to be any forbearance forms or repayment of a late payment form/agreement on the SPS website or in any SPS communications but they do state that these are options for consumers. 

Thank you for the help.  I look forward to speaking with you regarding the request for forbearance/repayment plan that we discussed.  And could you please make sure that you send me the bank loan numbers for each bank and the correct forms that I should fill out for SPS non-banking facility.  Again, thank you so much for the assistance in this matter, I look forward to your call.

Hi XXXX XXXX,

I am forwarding this email I sent to the Ombudsman XXXX XXXX.  It seems to me I should have filled out a forbearance or repayment form for the $XXXX rather than the RMA forms.  I brought my financial hardship to SPS attention in XXXX XXXX XXXX.  No one sent me  a letter that the RMA forms were denied.  This is extremely frustrating as it make it appear that I have not been communicating on this matter which is not true.  I have spoken every month with someone except after XXXX XXXX XXXX when SPS stopped communicating with me.  No messages, status updates, emails, or phone calls except for XXXX who called to set up three ACH payments. The third is due Saturday, XXXX XXXX XXXX.  

The LOD is for XXXX XXXX XXXX per XXXX XXXX, yet the letter states XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I requested a chance to make payment of $XXXX in full within six months.  XXXX stated that she would send this to a manager.  My thing is that I was not told of this ""denial"" in XXXX or any other time via SPS website that I have been monitoring.  Of course, I would not qualify for a RMA, I have one already so I should have been informed and given the forbearance and repayment paperwork to fill out which is not on the website and was never sent to me just the RMA forms, which you all received as I was denied a RMA.  I did notice after the phone call between XXXX and myself, I received an email at my personal address and on the website regarding the XXXX XXXX XXXX Event in XXXX, CO between XXXX-XXXX MST.  As XXXX and I spoke, I wondered why I would go to this if the only people that are going to be present are people that only fill out forms and have no earthly idea of what the loans and settlements state?  That is what I got from XXXX when she told me she did not know of XXXX XXXX $XXXX XXXX dollar settlement for subprime loans, the loans she is working with.  I'm getting confused as to SPS role. I understand SPS to be a debt collector only. They do not have rights to loan as they do not have a brokerage license in Utah, they cannot rewrite loans, they can only collect a check and threaten people with foreclosure. There is much double speak from XXXX, and it's not her fault, she is after all just reading off a computer screen and I doubt she or any of the ombudsman have a degree in finance.

I just think that if someone who initiated contact in XXXX XXXX, and is dealing in good faith with SPS, SPS, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, should follow the laws set forth in the criminal settlement agreements and afford the borrower/consumer who is dealing in good faith time to cure.  

I have notified the Colorado AG, HUD, and OIG per some guidance through SPS letters.  I want this situation corrected.  I have stated that through all of my communications yet, I get strung along in an attempt for XXXX to grab my home.  It will not happen.  I have been up front and fair.  XXXX, SPS and XXXX are the one's still attempting to scam the borrower.  According to HAMP and the settlements, I the borrower have a right to cure.  I need the appropriate paperwork given to me by SPS to fill out so I may exert that right.

Hi,

I sent the attached on the website yesterday.  I sent an email to SPS that I notified the OIG and today I received a call from SPS that they denied my request from XXXX XXXX XXXX for a hardship assistance.  If I could speak to someone that knows about the XXXX XXXX settlement and how the HAMP program works (which is online and very understandable in english and XXXX, however XXXX at SPS doesn't seem to understand how any of this works.) it would be greatly appreciated. XXXX told me that she didn't know anything about any of the banks and subprime fines and settlements that sent the U.S. crashing in XXXX. If she doesn't know anything about this why is she working at SPS?  Why is she coming to XXXX, CO., XXXX XXXX XXXX between the hours of XXXX-XXXX WITHOUT attorneys to explain the XXXX XXXX settlement to the people of Colorado? How can she help the people of Colorado or any other state with the XXXX XXXX settlement if she does not know the laws and speak on the laws of the HAMP/HARP modification program? This is deceitful business practice on the part of XXXX and SPS.  It's a money grab and another way for them to steal more homes from people in order to make up their XXXX in fines.  

The second attachment is what I got today when I logged on to SPS.  Still no messages, no status, no record initially for me to look at but I did capture a ghost page that I did file electronically in XXXX XXXX  and then per email XXXX XXXX XXXX by SPS deadline. XXXX told me that SPS sent me a decline letter. I told her I had not received any denial from SPS.  I owe 2 months payment $XXXX.  I told SPS that this was going to occur back in XXXX XXXX through email and phone and asked them if I could put it on the back of the loan or get a forbearance and that is when they had me fill out modification paperwork.  I didn't want a modification, I already had it, I just needed more time to catch up the 2 months because my disability payments weren't enough for all of my bills between XXXX XXXX and now.  I could not record today's call with XXXX so I asked her to send me a copy of the recorded call.  She said I could subpoena it.  I gave permission to record the call, I should be sent a copy of it.

I initiated the contact with SPS.  I knew that I was going to have issue's because I had to pay $XXXX for my XXXX degree so I could get an easier XXXX job so I don't have to live off XXXX.  All I was asking for was time for 2 months worth of payments and now SPS/XXXX says I'm in default (which technically I am, I know) but I thought these programs and settlements were set up to help people instead of harming them more.  I didn't ask for a subprime loan. I didn't ask to have XXXX XXXX and other major XXXX.  I've paid on this house since XXXX and have only had issues when XXXX bought out XXXX XXXX.  I've paid over $200,000 for a $XXXX loan since XXXX. I trusted XXXX.  I asked XXXX to put me in contact with XXXX because when I call they say they don't have me as a customer, yet SPS has no rights to change the loan they are just a servicer, debt collector.  XXXX stated that XXXX  denied the modification for me that they did in XXXX.  SPS has been taking my payments since then.  XXXX sold the servicing rights to SPS in the middle of my modification.  XXXX/SPS never filed with the county the modification papers but they accept my payments.  So the question becomes is the modification real/valid?  Is XXXX and SPS stealing money from me and thousands of others? XXXX doesn't have the original paper work or the original deed that is why they cannot file with the county.

I'm so over this. I'm sure you are as well.  I worked with Colorado Housing Authority for my modification.  SPS is doing the same business practices as they did when they were called XXXX XXXX XXXX.  The government shut them down and banned the owner from participating in any debt collecting or banking services.  Guess what...when the government shut down XXXX XXXX they allowed the employee's to change the name, open up SPS and they kept the same business practices.  You know, the practices that put us in the Great Depression in XXXX.

SPS and XXXX string people along until there is no return.  They do not follow the laws or settlement agreements.  This needs to be investigated.  Just type in SPS reviews and you get the same story over and over.  Thousands of people across the country cannot be colluding against the banking industry.

This is all in question now as the original modification with XXXX was transferred in the middle of the process to Select Portfolio Services formerly XXXX XXXX XXXX., shut down by ""you the government"" for engaging in a number of unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices in the servicing of subprime mortgage loans. XXXX was allowed to reopen as Select Portfolio Services and oversee HARP/HAMP modifications. The actual owner was not allowed to do business as SPS but his executive cronies were/are. 

The issue now is I am XXXX and I came upon a financial hardship recently and wrote/spoke with SPS.  They had me fill out RMA documents and offered ""modification/forbearance"" for the two payments that I have been behind on.  I have filled out the paperwork twice, once on their website and then I filled it out by hand and emailed everything to them on their timeline.  SPS has stopped communications with me.  I have NOT stopped communicating with them.  SPS sent me a  letter last week telling me to fill out ""modification forms"", yes the same modification forms that I already sent in.  Today, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from SPS stating that on XXXX XXXX XXXX between XXXX-XXXX  they are holding an event in XXXX at the XXXX to address the XXXX XXXX bulk settlement agreement.  SPS is doing the same thing they did as XXXX XXXX XXXX.  I will go into this meeting and come out of it with yet another modification that will not be filed appropriately with XXXX county as SPS/XXXX/whoever does not have original loan documents or my ORIGINAL DEED to the property.  I have requested on several occasions for SPS/XXXX  to produce the original Deed and they have refused.  So I would like you as the OIG office for housing to tell me how much longer to I get to be XXXX XXXX by these people?  I have made over $200,000 on this property since XXXX on a $XXXX loan with my mother. When she died, I received the DEED to the property due to insurance.  This would be why SPS/XXXX does not have the original DEED and why they have NOT filed the modification paperwork from XXXX, XXXX, or now.  Yes, I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and dealt with XXXX XXXX.  SPS has accepted my payments without filing with XXXX county.  Thus, they are still keeping the reputation of, ""engaging in a number of unfair, deceptive, and illegal practices in the servicing of subprime mortgage loans."" Which unfair practice, subprime loans, a made up interest rate, pick any that are in the SEC claims. 

Nobody deserved what these people did to them.  I'm much better off as I at least now know that I've been XXXX by SPS/XXXX and the government because everybody that works for these people lied and cheated not only me but thousands of people.  Yet, we continue to get XXXX and lied to and we have no recourse nor do we have the ability to hire attorneys that know what the hell is going on.  I can't afford an attorney.  I get $XXXX dollars per month.  I pay all of my XXXX medications as XXXX doesn't kick in until my $XXXX deductible. Yes I pay $XXXX bucks a month to XXXX for NO insurance coverage. I do however get discounts on my XXXX XXXX medications by XXXX XXXX in my community.  I'm suppose to be paying for my XXXX and XXXX from my XXXX XXXX, but I need to have gas, electric, and water in order to keep the XXXX XXXX running.  I can't afford to pay my utilities, medications, so I cut, I don't go to the doctor anymore because I cannot afford the co-pays.  I'm stuck right now through no fault of my own. XXXX just happens. I have tried and tried to correct the mess that I have found myself in by myself and with the help of Colorado Housing and XXXX XXXX.  But apparently NOTHING is enough.

The housing bubble that occurred in XXXX, is happening again because it is allowed by our government regardless of settlements.  Please stop this.  Please help me stop SPS/XXXX from taking my home that I have paid $XXXX for on a $XXXX loan.  I am a good citizen and I didn't deserve this nor did others deserve this.  I don't deserve it happening to me again.  How do I stop them?  They don't seem to have to follow the laws, regulations, or settlement agreements that have been set.

I am writing to complain Netspend ( XXXX XXXX ). My name is XXXX XXXX. My card number is XXXX. XXXX last year 2016 I opened both checking and savings account. At that time I chose the account plan - "" Pay as you go '', which charges me a fee when I use the card but does not charge me any monthly fee. 

However, recently I found out that my account was locked ( not sure when did this happen ) and I did n't get any notice during this whole year. They actually had my email address and my phone number on file. They locked my account and banned me from accessing my money without ANY notice, nor did they verify my identity before doing this. 

I just got access to my account these days and was surprised to find that I was charged monthly fee of {$5.00} for more than 1.5 years. Their representative could do nothing but kept asking many questions, and totally wasted my time. Every time I asked them to transfer me to their supervisor, the music is going on for around 1 hour, and another similar representative picked the call. Those people are just stonewalling and wasting customer 's time. 

Right now I strongly suspect they lock customer 's account in purpose and then charge fees on their account.

Each time asking for validation, I received a response back from Portfolio as being "" confused '' as to what it was that I was disputing or they sent a statement as validation. I did not request that Portfolio send me some computer printed out hearsay that they have no firsthand knowledge about. If they are going to attempt to validate, I am requesting that Portfolio send me a copy of a valid bilateral contract between heir company and me, signed by both parties, showing I have agreed to do business with them, showing my true, wet ink signature. What I received was basic verification and not validation. XXXX Law Dictionary defines verification and that requires a sworn affidavit, so what I received is not considered legal verification. I am requesting that Portfolio provide a full accounting of alleged claim. This means send me the documentation starting from the first deposit that created the alleged account that was supposedly lent to me and every charge, payment, credit, debit, fees, interest and any other event that took place on this alleged account to this present date. Please make sure that this full accounting has truthful entries that include insurance payments that were given to the original creditor when they filed a claim of alleged loss and notations of credits received from their filing of their Profit and Loss, as those are accounting facts as well. Oh, and I 'm also entitled to know how much Portfolio paid for this alleged account so please send me proof of the Bill of Sale and the price paid to purchase my information to create this account, which was done without my knowledge, without my consent, without a contract or agreement allowing Portfolio to subrogate on my behalf. What they did when they created this alleged account of their was commit fraud against me and perpetrate identity theft against me. I 'll also need a copy of the original contract between the original creditor and myself, again it must be bilateral with both parties signatures and unless Portfolio is named on that document as a party with an interest to protect, they are a stranger to the transaction, a mere volunteer and have NO RIGHTS as a creditor against me because they do n't qualify to make a claim against me according to the Doctrine of Subrogation. Until Portfolio can produce the above documents requested for VALIDATION also accompanied with a sworn Affidavit of Verification, the FDCPA REQUIRES them to stop all collection activity against me - and that includes furnishing and verifying information on my credit reports. So, please produce true validation or get out of my life! For now, IMMEDEDIATELY get off my credit reports as that is a violation of federal law since they have NOT validated and I reject what they sent as being validation or true verification. Lastly, I have reached out to my state Attorney General/licensing authority to verify if this company is licensed to report in my state or banned. I have also filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Board,  The Better Business Bureau and also looking into all additional legal rights and damages available.",Investigating,0,3,0,0,0,4,0,0,0

It is frustrating that there is no way to reach this company other than writing to them via mail. By the time my mail reaches them they would have deducted another monthly fee.

In a desperate need of cash, I reached out to them for a loan to pay some bills. Since the time I have gotten the loan, I have been struggling to pay it off due to enormous interest rate and the length of the loan. The other day I called and requested a copy of my contract detailing all the info of my contract, they would n't send it to me, the only thing they sent me was a detailed payment schedule of the payment left. 

In the state of Georgia payday lending is prohibited. 

In fact, there is a ban on payday lenders restricting their operation in the territory of the state according to the Industrial loan act ( Ga. Code Ann . 7-3-14. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 80 3-1.02 ( 7 ) and O. C.G.A. Section 16-17-1 et seq. ).

Payday loans go under a title of small loans, generally ; the minimal amount is {$3000.00}, according to the 16-17-2 of the Georgia Code.

Certain businesses and companies have a legal right to give such loans but in terms that all their operations are regulated by the Credit Card and Credit Card Banking Act. All the lenders wishing to operate in the state should adhere to 16 % small loan rate cap APR ( and 10 % per year discounted plus fees ) as well as 60 % per year criminal usury cap.

The Georgia Industrial Loan Act of 1955 essentially made payday lending illegal by requiring state licensing and registration and by imposing strict usury limits on small loans. In 2004, the Georgia General Assembly increased the fines and criminal penalties for people making small loans at illegal rates of interest. The law went into effect in XX/XX/XXXX 2004, and has survived challenges in federal court. Referred to as the Payday Lending Act of 2004, this law authorizes misdemeanor charges against violators, as well as fines of up to {$5000.00} per violation and a possible jail sentence of 1 year.",NFA,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
